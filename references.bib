@article{Moreira1992,
abstract = {A new saturation model for induction machines that can be easily extended to other types of AC machines is presented. It is shown that saturation is responsible for the generation of flux space harmonic components traveling in the air gap with the same synchronous speed as the fundamental flux component, with the third being the dominant harmonic component. Superposition of the effects of the fundamental and third harmonic components of the air gap flux is utilized in order to model the saturation of the ferromagnetic parts of the machine. The concept of winding functions is used to derive the inductance terms relating to both stator and rotor winding components. In this approach, the air gap length is assumed to be variable, being a function of the position and level of the air gap flux. Terminal and torque values for steady and transient states are obtainable from the proposed model, with experimental results showing that the model proposed predicts spatial saturation effects with good accuracy},

annote = {10 MW direct-drive system compared with other conventional generators

        
At present, the superconducting generators are not expected to have an impact on the onshore turbines due to the limited size growth.

        
the interest in wind turbine application has increased during the last five years [24–27]

        
A UK based project on HTS wind energy systems was also initiated in 2005 with Converteam as project leaders and with the goal to make a market entry of a 8 MW and 12 rpm direct drive generator by 2011 [25]. In 2007 American Superconductor initiated a joint research venture with TECO-Westinghouse with the goal to develop a 10 MW and 11 rpm direct drive generator [27].

        
Various wind turbine data is given !

        
COMSOL is used for 2D FEA analysis

        
HTS Tape Length estimations in the order of 1450 km for this paper, 200 km target for American Superconductor

        
The Converteam/Zenergy group has just recently published a discussion of the benefits of the superconducting drive train and estimated that it will bemore cost effective than permanent magnet direct drives above 5MW[32].

The design of a C-GEN generator requires the combination of electromagnetic, structural and thermal models. Two rotary prototypes of 15 \& 20kW have been constructed and tested and the 15kW prototype has been fitted to a wind turbine. A 1kW linear generator has been tested and is being modified for flooded operation meanwhile a larger 50kW prototype is being designed. A feasibility study of C-GEN technology in four different wave and tidal projects is being undertaken.},

(*) Similar to: Review of high power density superconducting generators: Present state and prospects for incorporating YBCO windings

        
Refrigerators

        
YBCO is more advantegous. Details of superconductivity state is given.

        

        
The workhorse of the cryocoolers is the Gifford–McMahon(G–M) regenerative cycle cryocooler.

        
Gifford-McMahon cryocoolers are slowly being replaced by
more advanced efficient cryocoolers, such as Stirling and Pulse Tube cryocoolers.
Large Stirling and Pulse Tube cryocoolers have just be- come available commercially after more than a decade of devel- opment. Onecryocooler, recently developed by the Air Force for a laser application, is a lightweight Stirling cryocooler weighing only 19 lbs and delivering 16 W of refrigeration at 80 K [10], [20].},

abstract = {Improved trapped fields are reported for bulk melt-textured YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO) material in the temperature range between 20 K and 50 K. Trapped fields up to 12.2 T were obtained at 22 K on the surface of single YBCO disks (with Ag and Zn additions). In YBCO mini-magnets, maximum trapped fields of 16 T (at 24 K) and of 11.2 T (at 47 K) were achieved using (Zn + Ag) and Zn additions, respectively. In all cases, the YBCO disks were encapsulated in steel tubes in order to reinforce the material against the large tensile stress acting during the magnetizing process and to avoid cracking. We observed cracking not only during the magnetizing process, but also as a consequence of flux jumps due to thermomagnetic instabilities in the temperature range betweeen 20 K and 30 K.},

abstract = {In this study, the feasibility of a direct-drive per- manent magnet generator for a tidal turbine power take-off system, namely MCT’s SeaGen –the world’s first full scale commercial tidal turbine– has been investigated. The investigated PM generator topology is called C-GEN which is an air-cored axial-flux generator developed in the University of Edinburgh. The C-GEN is prior to conventional PM generators by absence of magnetic attraction forces between rotor and stator, absence of cogging torque, ease of manufacturing, modularity and high fault-toleration [1]. Firstly, the integrated analytical design tool that couples electromagnetic, structural and thermal aspects of the generator has been introduced. Then, an optimization tool based on genetic algorithm has been used to maximize the annual electricity generation and to minimize the initial cost of the generator. The optimized generator is validated using FEA tools and the specifications of the generator has been presented. I.},

abstract = {The C-GEN is a novel topology of direct drive air-core permanent magnet generator being developed at University of Edinburgh [1]. The topology has many benefits such as; absence of cogging torque, reduced mass and ease of manufacturing. A 20 kW prototype test rig and 15kW machine for a wind turbine has been manufactured and tested previously. Initial sizing studies for wind turbines indicate that the C-GEN concept will be up to 50\% lighter than conventional iron cored PM direct drive generators [1]. In addition to the applications wind turbines, C-GEN technology can also be implemented for marine energy power take-off systems. To investigate that, a feasibility study is being undertaken in collaboration with two wave and two tidal energy companies. In this paper, design and optimization method of an axial flux permanent magnet generator for a tidal energy converter device has been investigated. An analytical optimization tool is designed that combines electromagnetic, structural and thermal aspects of the machine design. A genetic algorithm optimization method has been utilized based on the operation conditions of generator and pre-defined constraints on dimensions and material limitations. The output of the analytical design tool is compared with the electromagnetic FEA simulations. The results showed that proposed analytical calculation method is consistent with FEA results},

The comparative analysis of the different machines are done analytically. The analytical results are compared with finite element analysis results of simplified linearised equivalent models for the different coil configurations. The finite element analysis results correlate well with the analytical results in predicting a higher torque factor for small diameter, short stack RFAPM machines with concentrated coil configurations than for machines with overlapping coil configurations, with the same coil side-width values.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes the work completed under the CRADA between NREL and American Superconductor (AMSC). The CRADA combined NREL and AMSC resources to benchmark high temperature superconducting direct drive (HTSDD) generator technology by integrating the technologies into a conceptual wind turbine design, and comparing the design to geared drive and permanent magnet direct drive (PMDD) wind turbine configurations. Analysis was accomplished by upgrading the NREL Wind Turbine Design Cost and Scaling Model to represent geared and PMDD turbines at machine ratings up to 10 MW and then comparing cost and mass figures of AMSC’s HTSDD wind turbine designs to theoretical geared and PMDD turbine designs at 3.1, 6, and 10 MW sizes. Based on the cost and performance data supplied by AMSC, HTSDD technology has good potential to compete successfully as an alternative technology to PMDD and geared technology turbines in the multi megawatt classes. In addition, data suggests the economics of HTSDD turbines improve with increasing size, although several uncertainties remain for all machines in the 6 to 10 MW class.},

abstract = {Twenty years ago in a series of amazing discoveries it was found that a large family of ceramic cuprate materials exhibited superconductivity at temperatures above, and in some cases well above, that of liquid nitrogen. Imaginations were energized by the thought of applications for zero-resistance conductors cooled with an inexpensive and readily available cryogen. Early optimism, however, was soon tempered by the hard realities of these new materials: brittle ceramics are not easily formed into long flexible conductors; high current levels require near-perfect crystallinity; and--the downside of high transition temperature--performance drops rapidly in a magnetic field. Despite these formidable obstacles, thousands of kilometres of high-temperature superconducting wire have now been manufactured for demonstrations of transmission cables, motors and other electrical power components. The question is whether the advantages of superconducting wire, such as efficiency and compactness, can outweigh the disadvantage: cost. The remaining task for materials scientists is to return to the fundamentals and squeeze as much performance as possible from these wonderful and difficult materials.},

abstract = {The cost and mass of an offshore wind turbine power-train can be reduced by using high-temperature supercon- ducting generators, but for a successful commercial design the superconducting generator should be as reliable as its alternatives. In this paper, we present a novel transverse flux superconducting generator topology which is suitable for low-speed, high-torque applications. The generator is designed with a stationary superconducting field winding and a variable reluctance claw pole motor for simplified mechanical structure and maximum reliability. 3D FEA simulation results of a 70 kW prototype is presented.},

abstract = {The C-GEN is a novel permanent magnet generator aimed at reducing overall system mass in direct drive power takeoff applications. The design of a C-GEN generator requires the combination of electromagnetic, structural and thermal models. Models used in the development of design tools applicable to both rotary and linear C-GEN generators are described in this study. The design tool is verified with the experiment results obtained from a 15 kW prototype. A genetic optimisation algorithm is developed combining the analytical model with economical issues to search for most suitable designs for specific applications. Designs are presented using the optimisation design tool for two marine renewable applications: a wave device called Oyster developed by Aquamarine Power and a tidal current device developed by Scotrenewables.},

The machine has a stationary superconducting field winding which eliminates electrical brushes and cryocouplers. The machine is specifically designed for low-speed high torque applications such as large off- shore wind turbines. The proposed machine is robust and has a modular structure. A 30 kW, 100 rpm prototype is planned to be man- ufactured to prove the concept. MgB2, YBCO, BSSCO wires are compared in terms of wire length, operating temperature and cost. The magnetic flux penetrating into superconducting wire has been simulated using 3D FEA software. Moreover, mechanical loads is estimated and the deflections in the structure is analysed.

ASSMs can increase the motor efficiency but they raise the production costs due to increase of super- conductor resulting from magneto-motive force (MMF) loss. On the other hand, homopolar superconducting synchronous motors (HSSMs) can be reduced superconductor because rotor consisted of magnetic materials [4].

abstract = {For offshore wind energy, there is a trend toward larger wind turbines. The increased mass of a power-takeoff system increases the installation cost of the turbine. Direct-drive superconducting generators have the potential to reduce the installation cost of wind turbines. For a successful entry to the off- shore-wind-energy market, a high-temperature superconducting generator should be as reliable as conventional generators. It is proposed that a stationary superconducting direct-current-field winding may increase the reliability of the generator. An axial-flux homopolar generator topology is proposed to be used in low-speed high-torque applications. The topology is modified by using two superconducting field windings to obtain a bipolar flux-density distribution for higher power density. Different core types and dimensions were examined to find the most suitable design, and a conceptual design of a 6-MW 12-r/min generator is presented.},

@phdthesis{Keysan2014c,
abstract = {This thesis describes four novel superconducting machine concepts, in the pursuit of finding a suitable design for large offshore wind turbines. The designs should be reliable, modular and light-weight. The main novelty of the topologies reside in using a single loop shaped stationary superconducting field winding, which eliminates the rotating transfer couplers and electric brushes or brushless exciters. Furthermore, the electromagnetic forces in the superconducting wire are also eliminated, which simplifies the design and manufacturing of the cryostat and the support structure. Among the four topologies presented, the claw pole type machine is the most promising one. The rotor of the machine composes of claw-poles made from laminated electrical sheets, the superconducting field winding and the armature winding are stationary. The machine is analysed using 3D FEA simulations and a small linear machine prototype is manufactured to verify the simulations. For large scale applications, a double-sided claw pole machine is proposed, which has balanced magnetic attraction forces in the rotor. The machine has a modular cryostat structure, which increases the availability of the machine. Thus, even if a fault occurs in the cryocoolers or in the armature coils, the rest of the machine can operate at partial load until the maintenance is performed. Moreover, it is much easier to replace the faulty parts, as full disassemble of the machine is not required, and a small on- site crane can be used. As a result, it offers operational advantages over the existing superconducting topologies. A 10 MW, 10 rpm generator design is presented, which has a diameter of 6.6 m and an axial length of 1.4 m. The total active mass of the generator is 58 tonnes, and the structural mass is 126 tonnes, which gives a total mass of 184 tonnes. There are four independent cryostats and two independent armature windings in the machine to improve modularity. The biggest advantage of the design is the significantly less superconducting wire usage compared to any other designs; 10 MW machine just needs 15 km of MgB2 wire at 30 K. Thus, it is believed that the proposed topology is a very cost effective and suitable candidate for a successful entry to the wind turbine market.},

The main benefits are reduced overall system mass and ease of manufacturing, due to the use of an air-cored winding, but with a modular PM rotor consisting of C-core modules. A 15kW rotary prototype has been fitted and tested on a commercially available wind turbine. Initial sizing studies for wind indicate that the C-GEN concept will be up to 50\% lighter than conventional iron cored PM direct drive generators [10]. In addition to wind the C-GEN has applications in marine energy converters. The authors are working with four marine developers to investigate the feasibility of C-GEN for their technology. The results from two of those studies will be presented in this paper namely; Aquamarine Oyster device – near shore wave energy converter, Scotrenewables SRTT device – tidal current energy converter. In order to find the most optimum solution for the specific application; electromagnetic, thermal, structural and economical design aspects of the generator are defined and coupled using an analytical design tool. To evaluate different design variations an optimization tool is developed based on genetic algorithm. All these considerations make the optimised generator design a very close optimum solution for the “real-world”.},

abstract = {Rotor slot harmonics are found in the stator current waveforms for most squirrel-cage induction motors. These harmonics are caused by the finite number of rotor slots in a motor, and their frequencies are inherently correlated with the motor's rotational speed. A frequency demodulation approach is proposed in this paper to continuously and accurately track the rotational speed for induction motors that are operated at either dynamic or steady-state conditions from fixed-frequency power supplies. First, a complex current vector is synthesized from polyphase electrical current measurements. Second, a local oscillator and a mixer are cascaded with a digital filter to heterodyne a specific rotor slot harmonic and suppress adjacent interferences. A finite impulse response differentiator is then employed as a frequency demodulator to approximate the time derivative of the phase of this specific rotor slot harmonic and to resolve its instantaneous frequency. Finally, the induction motor speed is calculated from this resolved instantaneous rotor slot harmonic frequency. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is capable of interleaving data acquisition with real-time computation, iteratively estimating motor speed on a sample-by-sample basis.},

abstract = {Air-gap flux of all electrical machines contains harmonics. Some of these harmonics stem from rotor slotting of the machine. These harmonics can be utilized for control or diagnostic purposes. In the literature, rotor slot harmonics are mostly utilized for condition monitoring. There is also some research utilizing them for rotor speed estimation. However, it is observed that in the existing work spectral analysis techniques are employed which require long samples of data and in this from they are not suitable for vector control of induction motors. Accurate position information is vital for high performance vector control of induction motors. Furthermore using a sensor which requires some kind of modification on the motor is not desirable. A novel method has been proposed in this study that does not need any spectral estimation techniques. In this approach extracting the required information can be done within a typical control cycle of a vector controlled drive algorithm. Furthermore, any modification of the motor is not necessary. In this paper the proposed approach is presented. Experimental results illustrate that the position prediction accuracy of the approach is very high.},

quenching issues

        
insulation issues

        
However, superconductors have zero resistance only for dc, and when they are ramped or subjected to ac, they will generate some internal voltage which must be shielded from causing current flows in undesired direc- tions

        
An equally important property of superconductors is their ability to trap penetrating flux through internally circulating supercurrents, and this has been used to provide stable, strong magnetic bearings [26] and “permanent” magnets which are much stronger than the conventional variety. The material requirements for such ap- plications are clearly different from those for wires, since the superconductor is often in a block, bulk form.

        
Cryogenics carries notable burdens for superconducting machine. First is the cost of the cryogenic subsystem. It is not un- usual for the cryogenics to constitute half or more of the cost of using superconductors. Second is the added maintenance cost. The refrigerators require significant electrical power during op- eration and periodic replacement of various parts and filters, and the required vacuum insulation system can produce troublesome leaks if not manufactured and maintained well. Finally, the cryo- genic system constitutes a new addition to the potential unreli- ability of the overall system, and this must be countered with appropriate redundancy and other potentially expensive engi- neering measures.},

The effect of these variables on the energy ratio (ER), efficiencies, and other performance parameters is evaluated. Results obtained have shown that the mean values of power generated, energy ratio, and primary efficiency of CAES-IC system are about 7\% higher, 3.3\% lower, and 1\% higher than the corresponding values with CAES-AI system, respectively. The sensitivity rate of generated power, energy ratio, and primary efficiency of CAES-AI system is clearly higher than that of CAES-IC system due to ambient temperature and overall pressure ratio.},

@article{Barut2007,
abstract = {In this paper, extended-Kalman-filter-based estimation algorithms that could be used in combination with the speed-sensorless field-oriented control and direct-torque control of induction motors (IMs) are developed and implemented experimentally. The algorithms are designed aiming minimum estimation error in both transient and steady state over a wide velocity range, including very low and persistent zero-speed operation. A major challenge at very low and zero speed is the lost coupling effect from the rotor to the stator, which makes the information on rotor variables unobservable on the stator side. As a solution to this problem, in this paper, the load torque and the rotor angular velocity are simultaneously estimated, with the velocity taken into consideration via the equation of motion and not as a constant parameter, which is commonly the case in most past studies. The estimation of load torque, on the other hand, is performed as a constant parameter to account for Coulomb and viscous friction at steady state to improve the estimation performance at very low and zero speed. The estimation algorithms developed based on the rotor and stator fluxes are experimentally tested under challenging variations and reversals of the velocity and load torque (step-type and varying linearly with velocity) over a wide velocity range and at zero speed. In all the scenarios, the current estimation error has remained within a very narrow error band, also yielding acceptable velocity estimation errors, which motivate the use of the developed estimation method in sensorless control of IMs over a wide velocity range and persistent zero-speed operation},

abstract = {Controlled induction motor drives without mechanical sensors for speed or motor shaft position have the attraction of low cost and high reliability. The identification of rotor speed is generally based on measured terminal voltages and currents. Dynamic models are used to estimate the magnitude and spatial orientation of the fundamental magnetic flux waves in the stator or in the rotor. Open loop estimators and closed loop observers differ with respect to accuracy, robustness, and sensitivity against model parameter variations. Dynamic performance and steady-state speed accuracy in the low speed range is achieved by exploiting parasitic effects of the machine. The overview in this paper uses signal flow graphs of complex space vector quantities to provide an insightful description of the systems used in sensorless control of induction motors},

Schematic outline of a set of selected converter technologies is presented with a view to inferring their operational aspects in relation to wind energy systems. Considering the emerging nature of this immensely potential alternative energy sector, issues pertaining to their grid-integration and subsequent effect on electrical network are discussed in a qualitative and subjective manner. While the observations deduced in this work provide a general impression of the current technological trend, only further research, development, \& demonstration initiatives would reveal the scale and magnitude of the associated challenges. Nonetheless, this work may shed further light on how such near-commercial renewable technologies can be accommodated into long term resource planning scenarios, especially from the perspective of electrical utilities.},

abstract = {It is well known that slotting harmonics exist in most of the electrical machines. So far these harmonics are mainly identified using spectral estimation techniques. However, this approach requires long sampling and computation periods. In this study, a novel speed and position estimation method, based on identification of rotor slot harmonics that does not require any kind of spectral analysis is proposed. The required information is extracted by demodulating the information available in an external search coil (or in phase current). The algorithm used for this purpose is fast and can be applied within a typical control cycle of a vector controlled drive algorithm. In the application of the method here, higher order rotor slot harmonics have been utilized. In this manner, the position estimation resolution increases and also possible effect of harmonics stemming from other sources are avoided. The approach is explained in the paper and illustrated with experimental results.},

abstract = {It is well known that slotting harmonics exist in most of the electrical machines. These harmonics may supply valuable information for condition monitoring of bearings, windings or rotor bars. Utilization of these harmonics for rotor speed and position estimation is limited mainly due to long sampling periods required by spectral estimation techniques. In this study, a novel speed and position estimation method is proposed that does not need any kind of spectral estimation. In this approach extracting the required information can be done within a typical control cycle of a vector controlled drive algorithm. In the application of the method, higher order rotor slot harmonics have been utilized. The approach is explained in the paper and illustrated with experimental results.},

Bu bildiri sens\"{o}rs\"{u}z s\"{u}r\"{u}c\"{u}lerden sens\"{o}rl\"{u} s\"{u}r\"{u}c\"{u}ler kadar iyi performans elde etme sorununa bir \c{c}\"{o}z\"{u}m bulmak i\c{c}in yapılan bir \c{c}alışmayı anlatmaktadır. Performansı iyileştirmek i\c{c}in en akılcı yol motorun kendi geometrisinden kaynaklanan ve manyetik alan i\c{c}inde izleri takip edilebilen sinyalleri yakalamaktır. Bu tip bilgi rotor yuvarlaklığının bozukluğundan, stator ve rotor oluklarının yarattığı alan bozulmasından veya başka manyetik alan asimetrilerinden elde edilebilir. \"{O}zellikle rotor oluk harmonikleri diagnostik ama\c{c}lı olarak kullanıla gelmektedir. Bu yaklaşım motor akısı i\c{c}inde oluşan harmoniklerin akımda end\"{u}klediği gerilim bileşenlerini yakalayarak veya hava aralığı akısını algılayarak uygulanabilmektedir. Yapılan işlem akım veya end\"{u}klenen gerilimden bir \"{o}rnekleme yapmak ve FFT analiz y\"{o}ntemleri kullanılarak rotor oluklarından kaynaklanan bileşenleri ayırmak şeklinde olmaktadır. Ancak bu y\"{o}ntemde \"{o}rnek alınması ve hesaplama, mili saniye mertebesinde s\"{u}rmekte ve ger\c{c}ek zamanda uygulanması vekt\"{o}r kontrollu sistemler a\c{c}ısından herhangi bir fayda sağlamamaktadır. Burada sunulan yaklaşımda ise rotor oluk harmoniklerini i\c{c}eren sinyal ger\c{c}ek zamanda işlenebilmekte ve sonu\c{c} mikro saniyeler i\c{c}erisinde alınabilmektedir. Y\"{o}ntemin \"{o}z\"{u} motordan elde edilen sinyalin; besleme gerilimi frekansında bir gerilim \"{u}zerine bindirilmiş olarak rotor oluk harmoniklerini i\c{c}eren bir başka sinyalin varlığının farkına varılmış olmasıdır. Bu durumda rotor oluk harmoniklerini ayıklamak basit bir demod\"{u}lasyon işlemine d\"{o}n\"{u}şmektedir. Bildiri g\"{o}zlemin arkasında yatan teoriyi a\c{c}ıkladıktan sonra, demod\"{u}lasyon işleminin nasıl yapılacağını g\"{o}stermektedir. \"{O}ne s\"{u}r\"{u}len yaklaşım bir deney ortamında uygulanarak yaklaşımın ge\c{c}erliliği g\"{o}sterilmiştir. Bu yaklaşımla rotor olukları bir encoder gibi kullanılarak ger\c{c}ek zamanda sens\"{o}rs\"{u}z olarak rotor konumu veya hızı elde edilebilmektedir. Bu nedenle de sens\"{o}rs\"{u}z s\"{u}r\"{u}c\"{u}lerin performansının sens\"{o}rl\"{u} s\"{u}r\"{u}c\"{u}ler kadar iyi olması imkanı doğmaktadır.},

abstract = {Controlled speed sensorless AC motor drives have reached a stage of development permitting good dynamic performance above 3\% of rated speed. However, the accuracy of the rotor speed estimation under load remains sensitive to parameter errors of the internal machine model. This paper presents an approach that ensures high steady-state speed accuracy in addition to high dynamic performance. To eliminate the speed estimation error, the machine parameters are adapted online, based on the evaluation of rotor slot harmonic effects. A stator flux-oriented control scheme is implemented in a digital signal processor system to demonstrate the robustness of the speed estimation to parameter variations. Experimental results demonstrate that the control system advantageously combines high dynamic performance with accuracy of speed estimation},

Vacuum is used to thermally insulate the coil, with a total heat load of 40 W

        
The rotor shaft is sealed with ferrofluid seals inboard of the bearings to enable a vacuum of a few torr to be maintained within the active rotor chamber.

        
A max- imum power loss of 40 kW is measured for a speed of 10,000 rpm in 1 atmosphere pressure, and this shows the need for low pressure for high-speed operation},

The main significance of the generator topology is that the relative position of the magnets, copper and steel has been chosen so that there are no magnetic attraction forces between the stator and permanent magnet translator. The magnetic force between magnets is reacted within a self supporting structure. The lack of magnetic forces and the modular nature of the generator topology makes the manufacture and assembly of the generator easier than a conventional iron-cored permanent magnet generator. Modeling techniques used to design the generator topology are described and photos are presented to demonstrate the benefits of the topology in terms of manufacture and assembly.},

Parallel to the development of industry, academic research on horizontal-axis marine current turbines has also shown positive growth. This paper reviews previous research on horizontal-axis marine current turbines and provides a concise overview for future researchers who might be interested in horizontal-axis marine current turbines. The review covers several main aspects, such as: energy assessment, turbine design, wakes, generators, novel modifications and environmental impact. Future trends for research on horizontal-axis marine current turbines are also discussed.},

@article{Hodgins2011a,
abstract = {A linear generator topology is proposed for wave energy applications. The main significance of the generator topology is that the relative position of the magnets, copper and steel has been chosen so that there are no magnetic attraction forces between the stator and permanent magnet translator. The lack of magnetic forces and the modular nature of the generator topology makes the manufacture and assembly of the generator easier than a conventional iron-cored permanent magnet linear generator. Analytical modelling techniques are described with a genetic algorithm optimization method. The proposed topology is implemented to Archimedes Wave Swing wave energy converter. A 50 kW prototype has been built to prove the concept and the no-load and load test results are presented.},

The proposed approach is tested on an induction motor driven by the mains supply. The experiments are repeated with a PWM supply. It is shown that the method works well in both cases and the number of rotor slots of the test machine is accurately predicted.},

critical temperatures of superconducting material

        
The cost to cool superconducting coils is roughly proportional to the inverse of the operating temperature in Kelvin.

        
The cryocooler system required for a 6000 hp motor is 0.5 m3

        
Advances in cryocooler reliability and reduction of maintenance have been made in parallel with HTS materials development. A cryocooler of the rating required for a 6000 hp motor, today, has a required maintenance cycle of 10 000 hours.Smaller cryocoolers, developed for HTS based
electronics, have been developed to be maintenance free, with field-proven MTBF of over 500 000 hours [9].},

abstract = {Distributed generation with a combustion engine prime mover is still widely used to supply electric power in a variety of applications. These applications range from backup power supply systems and combined wind-diesel generation to providing power in places where grid connection is either technically impractical or financially uneconomic. Modelling of such systems as a whole is extremely difficult due to the long-time load profiles needed and the computational difficulty of including small time-constant electrical dynamics with large time-constant mechanical dynamics. This paper presents the development of accelerated, reduced-order models of a distributed internal combustions engine generator unit. Overall these models are shown to achieve a massive improvement in the computational time required for long-time simulations while also achieving an extremely high level of dynamic accuracy. It is demonstrated how these models are derived, used and verified against benchmark models created using established techniques. Throughout the paper the modelling set as a whole, including multi level detail, is presented, detailed and finally summarised into a crucial tool for general system investigation and multiple target optimisation.},

abstract = {The study in this paper investigates whether the air gap harmonics can be identified by using an external search coil placed on the frame of an induction motor. For this purpose the study focuses on the prediction of rotor speed of an induction motor from external search coil emf, using spectral analysis techniques. In the first stage of the study the type of search coil which maximizes the induced emf is sought, also the position of the coil on the induced emf is investigated. Several motors are tested with a sinusoidal supply as well as a PWM inverter power supply and the search coil voltage is sampled. FFT analysis of the recorded data is performed in Matlab environment. An algorithm is developed for identifying the rotor speed using the FFT analysis results. It is shown that the developed algorithm is capable of predicting the motor speed under various load conditions and motor speeds. The speed estimation accuracy of this approach is also discussed. In short, this paper illustrates that the induced emf in an external search coil contains information on air gap harmonics, and these harmonics can be identified even when the motors are supplied with a PWM inverter.},

abstract = {This paper details the design and testing of a novel transverse flux claw pole linear machine suitable for large superconducting generators. The machine utilises a modular claw pole transducer design with a stationary field winding which eliminates the need for cryogenic couplers and electrical brushes for a superconducting machine. The results from this prototype will enable a better understanding of the electromagnetic and mechanical structures before embarking on a more costly super- conducting design. The structure of the prototype supports a field winding and core; four pairs of claw poles with a stroke of 500 mm; three armature windings and core. Tests will be preformed to determine the deflection of the airgap, field core and armature core, the induced voltage in the armature coils, the forces acting on the structure and the flux density variation in the claw poles.},

abstract = {Controlled induction motor drives without mechanical sensors for speed or motor shaft position have the attraction of low cost and high reliability. The identification of rotor speed is generally based on measured terminal voltages and currents. Dynamic models are used to estimate the magnitude and spatial orientation of the fundamental magnetic flux waves in the stator or in the rotor. Open loop estimators and closed loop observers differ with respect to accuracy, robustness, and sensitivity against model parameter variations. Dynamic performance and steady-state speed accuracy in the low speed range is achieved by exploiting parasitic effects of the machine. The overview in this paper uses signal flow graphs of complex space vector quantities to provide an insightful description of the systems used in sensorless control of induction motors},

abstract = {There is a trend toward higher power rated machines for offshore wind turbines. The maximum power rating for a high-speed, geared power-takeoff system is around 5MW. For even higher power rated turbines, direct-drive generators becomes enormously heavy. Direct-drive superconducting generators have the potential to reduce the overall mass and installation costs of an offshore wind turbine. In this study, a conventional homopolar superconducting generator design is presented that is suitable for low-speed, high-torque direct- drive applications. The generator has been designed with a stationary dc-field winding to increase the reliability of the generator. Also, a linear version of the generator is presented.},

abstract = {The paper deals with the validity of various dynamic models of induction machines. The fifth-order Park model and various reduced-order models are used to predict the low-frequency dynamic response of a 15 kW induction machine, and the theoretical results are compared with an extensive series of measurements. Several transfer functions are investigated in the perturbation frequency region below 35 Hz using three types of basic excitations: perturbations in the shaft torque, supply voltage and supply frequency. The maximum perturbation frequency for an error less than 10\% is used to study the validity range of the models; this range is evaluated for each model and transfer function, using the data of 31 different machines. The influence of the machine parameters and various physical phenomena is studied. The results show that a large number of transfer functions is needed for judging the general validity of a dynamic model},

abstract = {A new approach to the design optimisation of three-phase electric motors is presented. The novelty lies in combining a motor analysis procedure with a genetic algorithm to optimise an objective function such as the motor torque, the efficiency, the material cost or some other motor figures or a combination of these. Two approaches to the motor analysis are presented: the first is based on a fully analytical procedure; while the second utilises the finite element method. Some optimised design examples, with reference to surface-mounted permanent-magnet three-phase motors, are included, and a comparison between the genetic algorithm optimisation technique and the classical hill-climbing direct-search method is made. A discussion on the limitations and benefits of the proposed design approach concludes the paper},

abstract = {Large-grain high-temperature superconductors of the form RE-Ba-Cu-O (where RE is a rare-earth element) can trap magnetic fields of several tesla at low temperatures, and so can be used for permanent magnet applications. The magnitude of the trapped field is proportional to the critical current density and the volume of the superconductor. Various potential engineering applications for such magnets have emerged, and some have already been commercialized. However, the range of applications is limited by poor mechanical stability and low thermal conductivity of the bulk superconductors; RE-Ba-Cu-O magnets have been found to fracture during high-field activation, owing to magnetic pressure. Here we present a post-fabrication treatment that improves the mechanical properties as well as thermal conductivity of a bulk Y-Ba-Cu-O magnet, thereby increasing its field-trapping capacity. First, resin impregnation and wrapping the materials in carbon fibre improves the mechanical properties. Second, a small hole drilled into the centre of the magnet allows impregnation of Bi-Pb-Sn-Cd alloy into the superconductor and inclusion of an aluminium wire support, which results in a significant enhancement of thermal stability and internal mechanical strength. As a result, 17.24 T could be trapped, without fracturing, in a bulk Y-Ba-Cu-O sample of 2.65 cm diameter at 29 K.},

abstract = {In industrial drives market, speed and position estimation is one of the most important subjects for accurate motor drives. Vector controlled drives has the best dynamic performance among AC motor drives. Sensorless vector control is one of the most studied one. However, sensorless drive systems fail at low or zero speeds and may not have enough accuracy. For better accuracy and speed range speed sensors or position encoders are usually essential. However, coupling of sensor and sensor prices introduces extra cost on the drive. Thus in order to reduce the cost of the drive a cheap and easy to mount speed sensors is essential. Throughout out this study, a speed and position sensor using an external search coil placed between cooling fins on the frame of an induction machine is proposed. The search coil utilizes the fringing flux outside the frame of induction motor. Using the induced voltage on the external search coil, a new method that estimates the flux and rotor position is proposed. In this study, the induced voltage on the search coils are investigated with different types of search coils placed on various positions. And the frequency domain and time domain analysis are performed in order to build a model that can estimate machine flux, rotor speed and rotor position. As a result of this study, a low cost, easy to mount speed and position sensor is designed and implemented. Experiment results are presented.},

abstract = {A novel sensorless speed identifier for real-time application in induction motor drives under steady-state and transient conditions is proposed. It is based on the calculation of rotor slot harmonic (RSH) frequencies using an adaptive digital filter. It outperforms other analog or spectrum-based RSH speed identifiers in terms of accuracy and speed of response. The new identifier measures the speed with less than 0.1\% error by processing the stator current on a sample-by-sample basis. It is also capable of tracking speed transients of high slew rates with high accuracy. The authors believe this to be the first effective tracking of RSHs during transients ever reported. The proposed algorithm is computationally very efficient and requires only a single processor for its real-time implementation. Simulated and experimental data were used to validate the algorithm},

Most large HTS machines projects to date have used a
topology similar to conventional large synchronous machines, with a DC field winding on the rotor wound with HTS wire, and a copper AC stator winding at conventional temperature.

        
This advantage become greater as the size of the machine increases[14]},

abstract = {The Archimedes Wave Swing (AWS) is a system that converts ocean wave energy into electric energy. The goal of the research described in this paper is to identify the most suitable generator type for this application. Of the more conventional generator types, the three-phase permanent-magnet synchronous generator with iron in both stator and translator is most suitable, because it is cheaper and more efficient than the induction generator, the switched reluctance generator and the permanent. magnet generator with air-gap winding. The paper also proposes a new transverse-flux permanent-magnet generator topology that could be suitable for this application. This new double double-sided TFPM generator has flux concentrators, magnets, and conductors on the stator, while the translator only consists of iron.},

abstract = {C-GEN is a new topology of direct-drive permanent magnet generator being developed at University of Edinburgh. The main benefits are reduced overall system mass and ease of manufacturing, due to the use of an air-cored winding, but with a modular PM rotor consisting of C-core modules. A 15kW rotary prototype has been fitted and tested on a commercially available wind turbine. Initial sizing studies for wind indicate that the C-GEN concept will be up to 50\% lighter than conventional iron cored PM direct drive generators [10]. In addition to wind the C-GEN has applications in marine energy converters. The authors are working with four marine developers to investigate the feasibility of C-GEN for their technology. The results from two of those studies will be presented in this paper namely; Aquamarine Oyster device – near shore wave energy converter, Scotrenewables SRTT device – tidal current energy converter. In order to find the most optimum solution for the specific application; electromagnetic, thermal, structural and economical design aspects of the generator are defined and coupled using an analytical design tool. To evaluate different design variations an optimization tool is developed based on genetic algorithm. All these considerations make the optimised generator design a very close optimum solution for the “real-world”.},

The main significance of the generator topology is that the relative position of the magnets, copper and steel has been chosen so that there are no magnetic attraction forces between the stator and permanent magnet translator. The lack of magnetic forces and the modular nature of the generator topology makes the manufacture and assembly of the generator easier than a conventional iron-cored permanent magnet linear generator. Analytical modelling techniques are described with a genetic algorithm optimization method. The proposed topology is implemented to Archimedes Wave Swing wave energy converter. A 50 kW prototype has been built to prove the concept and the no-load and load test results are presented.},

annote = {10 MW direct-drive system compared with other conventional generators

        
At present, the superconducting generators are not expected to have an impact on the onshore turbines due to the limited size growth.

        
the interest in wind turbine application has increased during the last five years [24–27]

        
A UK based project on HTS wind energy systems was also initiated in 2005 with Converteam as project leaders and with the goal to make a market entry of a 8 MW and 12 rpm direct drive generator by 2011 [25]. In 2007 American Superconductor initiated a joint research venture with TECO-Westinghouse with the goal to develop a 10 MW and 11 rpm direct drive generator [27].

        
Various wind turbine data is given !

        
COMSOL is used for 2D FEA analysis

        
HTS Tape Length estimations in the order of 1450 km for this paper, 200 km target for American Superconductor

        
The Converteam/Zenergy group has just recently published a discussion of the benefits of the superconducting drive train and estimated that it will bemore cost effective than permanent magnet direct drives above 5MW[32].

In this paper, we present a novel transverse flux superconducting generator topology which is suitable for low-speed, high-torque applications. The generator is designed with a stationary superconducting field winding and a variable reluctance claw pole motor for simplified mechanical structure and maximum reliability. 3D FEA simulation results of a 70 kW prototype is presented.},

abstract = {In this study, the feasibility of a direct-drive per- manent magnet generator for a tidal turbine power take-off system, namely MCT’s SeaGen –the world’s first full scale commercial tidal turbine– has been investigated. The investigated PM generator topology is called C-GEN which is an air-cored axial-flux generator developed in the University of Edinburgh. The C-GEN is prior to conventional PM generators by absence of magnetic attraction forces between rotor and stator, absence of cogging torque, ease of manufacturing, modularity and high fault-toleration [1]. Firstly, the integrated analytical design tool that couples electromagnetic, structural and thermal aspects of the generator has been introduced. Then, an optimization tool based on genetic algorithm has been used to maximize the annual electricity generation and to minimize the initial cost of the generator. The optimized generator is validated using FEA tools and the specifications of the generator has been presented. I.},

abstract = {The second phase of an investigation of the phenomena and variables which control the rate of heat transfer in the air gap of a rotating electrical machine is reported. Experimental data for diabatic flow in an annulus are summarized and compared with the results of previous studies. The data are examined in terms of the types of fiow processes occurring in an annulus, and it is found that the results for diabatic fiow clearly confirm those obtained for adiabatic fiow in showing the existence of three, and possibly four, modes of fiow in this annulus. These modes are: (1) Laminar flow; (2) laminar-plus-Taylor- vortexes flow; (3) turbulent flow; (4) turbulent-plus-vortexes flow. The heat- transfer data were subdivided into the following two limiting cases and one general case: (1) axial flow with zero rotation; (2) rotation of inner cylinder with zero axial flow; (3) general case of combined axial fiow and rotation. The heat-transfer data from this study and of previous investigations were correlated in terms of Reynolds number and Taylor number over a wide range of these variables in terms of fairly simple equations. Radial temperature profiles in the annular gap were measured for the diabatic fiow and aided in the understanding of the different flow phenomena in the annulus with an inner rotating cylinder.

The main significance of the generator topology is that the relative position of the magnets, copper and steel has been chosen so that there are no magnetic attraction forces between the stator and permanent magnet translator. The magnetic force between magnets is reacted within a self supporting structure. The lack of magnetic forces and the modular nature of the generator topology makes the manufacture and assembly of the generator easier than a conventional iron-cored permanent magnet generator. Modeling techniques used to design the generator topology are described and photos are presented to demonstrate the benefits of the topology in terms of manufacture and assembly.},

abstract = {The C-GEN is a novel topology of direct drive air-core permanent magnet generator being developed at University of Edinburgh [1]. The topology has many benefits such as; absence of cogging torque, reduced mass and ease of manufacturing. A 20 kW prototype test rig and 15kW machine for a wind turbine has been manufactured and tested previously. Initial sizing studies for wind turbines indicate that the C-GEN concept will be up to 50\% lighter than conventional iron cored PM direct drive generators [1]. In addition to the applications wind turbines, C-GEN technology can also be implemented for marine energy power take-off systems. To investigate that, a feasibility study is being undertaken in collaboration with two wave and two tidal energy companies. In this paper, design and optimization method of an axial flux permanent magnet generator for a tidal energy converter device has been investigated. An analytical optimization tool is designed that combines electromagnetic, structural and thermal aspects of the machine design. A genetic algorithm optimization method has been utilized based on the operation conditions of generator and pre-defined constraints on dimensions and material limitations. The output of the analytical design tool is compared with the electromagnetic FEA simulations. The results showed that proposed analytical calculation method is consistent with FEA results},

abstract = {This paper summarizes the work completed under the CRADA between NREL and American Superconductor (AMSC). The CRADA combined NREL and AMSC resources to benchmark high temperature superconducting direct drive (HTSDD) generator technology by integrating the technologies into a conceptual wind turbine design, and comparing the design to geared drive and permanent magnet direct drive (PMDD) wind turbine configurations. Analysis was accomplished by upgrading the NREL Wind Turbine Design Cost and Scaling Model to represent geared and PMDD turbines at machine ratings up to 10 MW and then comparing cost and mass figures of AMSC’s HTSDD wind turbine designs to theoretical geared and PMDD turbine designs at 3.1, 6, and 10 MW sizes. Based on the cost and performance data supplied by AMSC, HTSDD technology has good potential to compete successfully as an alternative technology to PMDD and geared technology turbines in the multi megawatt classes. In addition, data suggests the economics of HTSDD turbines improve with increasing size, although several uncertainties remain for all machines in the 6 to 10 MW class.},

For even higher power rated turbines, direct-drive generators becomes enormously heavy. Direct-drive superconducting generators have the potential to reduce the overall mass and installation costs of an offshore wind turbine. In this study, a conventional homopolar superconducting generator design is presented that is suitable for low-speed, high-torque direct- drive applications. The generator has been designed with a stationary dc-field winding to increase the reliability of the generator. Also, a linear version of the generator is presented.},

abstract = {For offshore wind energy, there is a trend toward larger wind turbines. The increased mass of a power-takeoff system increases the installation cost of the turbine. Direct-drive superconducting generators have the potential to reduce the in- stallation cost of wind turbines. For a successful entry to the off- shore-wind-energy market, a high-temperature superconducting generator should be as reliable as conventional generators. It is proposed that a stationary superconducting direct-current-field winding may increase the reliability of the generator. An axial-flux homopolar generator topology is proposed to be used in low-speed high-torque applications. The topology is modified by using two superconducting field windings to obtain a bipolar flux-density distribution for higher power density. Different core types and dimensions were examined to find the most suitable design, and a conceptual design of a 6-MW 12-r/min generator is presented.},

abstract = {In this study, the feasibility of a direct-drive per- manent magnet generator for a tidal turbine power take-off system, namely MCT’s SeaGen –the world’s first full scale commercial tidal turbine– has been investigated. The investigated PM generator topology is called C-GEN which is an air-cored axial-flux generator developed in the University of Edinburgh. The C-GEN is prior to conventional PM generators by absence of magnetic attraction forces between rotor and stator, absence of cogging torque, ease of manufacturing, modularity and high fault-toleration [1]. Firstly, the integrated analytical design tool that couples electromagnetic, structural and thermal aspects of the generator has been introduced. Then, an optimization tool based on genetic algorithm has been used to maximize the annual electricity generation and to minimize the initial cost of the generator. The optimized generator is validated using FEA tools and the specifications of the generator has been presented. I.},

@article{Keysan2011b,
abstract = {For offshore wind energy, there is a trend toward larger wind turbines. The increased mass of a power-takeoff system increases the installation cost of the turbine. Direct-drive superconducting generators have the potential to reduce the in- stallation cost of wind turbines. For a successful entry to the off- shore-wind-energy market, a high-temperature superconducting generator should be as reliable as conventional generators. It is proposed that a stationary superconducting direct-current-field winding may increase the reliability of the generator. An axial-flux homopolar generator topology is proposed to be used in low-speed high-torque applications. The topology is modified by using two superconducting field windings to obtain a bipolar flux-density distribution for higher power density. Different core types and dimensions were examined to find the most suitable design, and a conceptual design of a 6-MW 12-r/min generator is presented.},

abstract = {This paper describes a hybrid method for calculating the performance of a coreless stator axial flux permanent-magnet (AFPM) generator. The method uses a combination of finite-element analysis and theoretical analysis. The method is then incorporated into a multidimensional optimization procedure to optimally design a large power coreless stator AFPM generator. The measured performance of the manufactured prototype compares favorably with the predicted results. The design approach can be applied successfully to optimize the design of the coreless stator AFPM machine.},

abstract = {A linear generator topology is proposed for wave energy applications. The main significance of the generator topology is that the relative position of the magnets, copper and steel has been chosen so that there are no magnetic attraction forces between the stator and permanent magnet translator. The lack of magnetic forces and the modular nature of the generator topology makes the manufacture and assembly of the generator easier than a conventional iron-cored permanent magnet linear generator. Analytical modelling techniques are described with a genetic algorithm optimization method. The proposed topology is implemented to Archimedes Wave Swing wave energy converter. A 50 kW prototype has been built to prove the concept and the no-load and load test results are presented.},

abstract = {For offshore wind energy, there is a trend toward larger wind turbines. The increased mass of a power-takeoff system increases the installation cost of the turbine. Direct-drive superconducting generators have the potential to reduce the in- stallation cost of wind turbines. For a successful entry to the off- shore-wind-energy market, a high-temperature superconducting generator should be as reliable as conventional generators. It is proposed that a stationary superconducting direct-current-field winding may increase the reliability of the generator. An axial-flux homopolar generator topology is proposed to be used in low-speed high-torque applications. The topology is modified by using two superconducting field windings to obtain a bipolar flux-density distribution for higher power density. Different core types and dimensions were examined to find the most suitable design, and a conceptual design of a 6-MW 12-r/min generator is presented.},

Two approaches to the motor analysis are presented: the first is based on a fully analytical procedure; while the second utilises the finite element method. Some optimised design examples, with reference to surface-mounted permanent-magnet three-phase motors, are included, and a comparison between the genetic algorithm optimisation technique and the classical hill-climbing direct-search method is made.

abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

abstract = {My first experience with scientific writing in English was the translation of my Chinese B.S. thesis. By the time I graduated with a PhD from State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1990, I had more than 20 publications. However, my understanding of how to write high-quality scientific papers remained at an elementary level and was limited to minimization of grammatical errors. This happened because most of the time I simply accepted the changes made to my manuscript by my PhD. advisors, Dr. George Stell and Dr. Harold L. Friedman, without knowing or asking why. During my postdoctoral study at North Carolina State University, my mentor, Dr. Carol Hall, encouraged me to attend a two-day writing workshop at the neighboring Duke University. The workshop taught by Professor Gopen truly opened my eyes. For the first time, I learned that readers have expectations when they read, and the most effective way to write is to fulfill their expectations. This workshop helped me write my first research proposal, and I was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship to work with Dr. Martin Karplus at Harvard University. During the five years at Harvard, Professor Karplus made me realize that a good paper requires an in-depth, tough, and thorough self-review. Now, I am a professor myself with my own research group. I constantly feel the need to teach my students and postdocs to write better. I do not consider myself an expert in scientific writing, but I do think that sharing my understanding and writing experience might help others to avoid the long journey that I took to sharpen my writing skills. If you have any comments and suggestions, please feel free to email me (yqzhou@iupui.edu). You are also welcome to visit my webpage: http://sparks.informatics.iupui.edu.},

abstract = {Effective approach to study and writing on experimental topics (ETs) for engineering postgraduate (PG) theses, consolidated by a survey among former graduates, is elaborated. Real life learning, easier writing and invaluable data set are among the benefits of ETs while considerable time, resources and energy required are the main setbacks compared to theoretical, analytical, computerised simulations or numerical topics. These advantages and disadvantages are first discussed. Guides are given then on good experimental practices including planning the number of tests, recording as tests proceeds, and use of a bound notebook. The value of ‘negative’ data, importance of error analysis, proper data organisation and presentation are discussed. Some frequent mistakes in curve fitting and correlation studies are introduced referring to real-life examples from theses and published papers. The huge potential in raw experimental data for future academic use beyond the thesis is also pronounced. Several practical guides for reporting the research raised and a typical outline for theses on ETs is suggested. Findings from the survey on theses of former PG graduates, presently lecturers at a young engineering university in Malaysia, are critically reported throughout the paper.},

abstract = {This book presents a theory of learning that starts with the assumption that engagement in social practice is the fundamental process by which we get to know what we know and by which we become who we are. The primary unit of analysis of this process is neither the individual nor social institutions, but the informal 'communities of practice' that people form as they pursue shared enterprises over time. To give a social account of learning, the theory explores in a systematic way the intersection of issues of community, social practice, meaning, and identity. The result is a broad framework for thinking about learning as a process of social participation. This ambitious but thoroughly accessible framework has relevance for the practitioner as well as the theoretician, presented with all the breadth, depth, and rigor necessary to address such a complex and yet profoundly human topic.},

Most large HTS machines projects to date have used a

At present, the superconducting generators are not expected to have an impact on the onshore turbines due to the limited size growth.

        
the interest in wind turbine application has increased during the last five years [24–27]

        
A UK based project on HTS wind energy systems was also initiated in 2005 with Converteam as project leaders and with the goal to make a market entry of a 8 MW and 12 rpm direct drive generator by 2011 [25]. In 2007 American Superconductor initiated a joint research venture with TECO-Westinghouse with the goal to develop a 10 MW and 11 rpm direct drive generator [27].

Internet and other technological developments have enabled the collection of richer data and new approaches to research assessment exercises. Open access strongly advocates for maximizing research impact by enhancing seamless accessibility. In addition, new tools and strategies have been used by open access journals and repositories to showcase how science can benefit from free online dissemination. Latest players in the debate include initiatives based on alt-metrics, which enrich the landscape with promising indicators. To start with, the article gives a brief overview of the debate and the role of open access in advancing a new frame to assess science. Next, the work focuses on the strategy that the Spanish National Research Council’s repository DIGITAL.CSIC is implementing to collect a rich set of statistics and other metrics that are useful for repository administrators, researchers and the institution alike. A preliminary analysis of data hints at correlations between free dissemination of research through DIGITAL.CSIC and enhanced impact, reusability and sharing of CSIC science on the web.},

Proponents of the altmetrics approach point out that these new media allow for new avenues of scientific impact assessment. Traditional impact measures based on bibliographic analysis have long been criticized for overlooking the relational dynamic of scientific impact. We therefore propose an application of social network analysis to researchers’ interactions on an academic social networking site in order to generate new metrics of scientific impact. Based on a case study conducted among a sample of Swiss management scholars, we analyze how these new relational metrics relate to traditional, offline impact indicators as well as online communication activity and publication resonance. We conclude that a relational approach based on social network analysis may add richness and differentiation to scientific impact assessment.},

abstract = {Traditional pre-publication peer review of scientific output is a slow, inefficient, and unreliable process. Efforts to replace or supplement traditional evaluation models with open evaluation platforms that leverage advances in information technology are slowly gaining traction, but remain in the early stages of design and implementation. Here I discuss a number of considerations relevant to the development of such platforms. I focus particular attention on three core elements that next-generation evaluation platforms should strive to emphasize, including (a) open and transparent access to accumulated evaluation data, (b) personalized and highly customizable performance metrics, and (c) appropriate short-term incentivization of the userbase. Because all of these elements have already been successfully implemented on a large scale in hundreds of existing social web applications, I argue that development of new scientific evaluation platforms should proceed largely by adapting existing techniques rather than engineering entirely new evaluation mechanisms. Successful implementation of open evaluation platforms has the potential to substantially advance both the pace and the quality of scientific publication and evaluation, and the scientific community has a vested interest in shifting towards such models as soon as possible.},

abstract = {Abstract    While the EU is building an open access infrastructure of archives (e.g., Openaire) and it is trying to implement it in the Horizon 2020 program, the gap between the tools and the human beings – researchers, citizen scientists, students, ordinary people – is still wide. The necessity to dictate open access publishing as a mandate for the EU funded research – ten years after the BOAI - is an obvious symptom of it: there is a chasm between the net and the public use of reason. To escalate the advancement and the reuse of research, we should federate the multitude of already existing open access journals in federal open overlay journals that receive their contents from the member journals and boost it with their aggregation power and their semantic web tools.  The article contains both the theoretical basis and the guidelines for a project whose goals are:   making open access journals visible, highly cited and powerful, by federating them into wide disciplinary overlay journals;   avoiding the traps of the “authors pay” open access business model, by exploiting one of the virtue of federalism: the federate journals can remain little and affordable, if they gain visibility from the power of the federal overlay journal aggregating them;  enriching the overlay journals both through semantic annotation tools and by means of open platforms dedicated to host ex post peer review and experts comments;  making the selection and evaluation processes and their resulting data as much as possible public and open, to avoid the pitfalls (e.g., the serials price crisis) experienced by the closed access publishing model.   It is about time to free academic publishing from its expensive walled gardens and to put to test the tools that can help us to transform it in one open forest, with one hundred flowers – and one hundred trailblazers.},

abstract = {One of the promises of Web Science is to leverage the wisdom of the crowds to give rise to emergent, bottom-up semantics, by making it easy for users to express relationships between arbitrary kinds of objects. Rather than starting with an ontology that determines the kinds of objects and relationships to be described and reasoned about, the idea is to give users the freedom to annotate arbitrary objects with arbitrary predicates, along with incentives for such annotations. Social tagging systems for images are one example, where the motivation can stem from the wish to organize and share one’s photos or from entertaining games to guess one another’s tags. Here we explore a similar approach in the domain of scholarly publications. We describe a system called Scholarometer, which provides a service to scholars by computing citation-based impact measures. This motivates users to provide disciplinary annotations for authors, which in turn can be used to compute for the first time measures that allow to compare authors’ impact across disciplinary boundaries. We show how this crowdsourcing approach can lead to emergent semantic networks to study interdisciplinary annotations and trends.},

For example, in services that use citation data to compute the impact of authors, ambiguous names lead to biased measures. The prob- lem is amplified where names are collected from heterogeneous sources, including crowdsourced annotations. This is the case in the Scholarometer system, which cross-correlates author names in user queries with those retrieved from bibliographic data. The uncontrolled nature of user-generated annotations is very valuable, but creates the need to detect ambiguous names. In this paper, we propose an approach to detect ambiguous names at query time, which makes it applicable in the context of a social computing application. We explore two kinds of heuristic features based on citations and crowdsourced topics. Our approach can detect ambiguous author names in crowdsourced scholarly data with an accuracy of 75\%.},

@article{Good2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND:Academic social tagging systems, such as Connotea and CiteULike, provide researchers with a means to organize personal collections of online references with keywords (tags) and to share these collections with others. One of the side-effects of the operation of these systems is the generation of large, publicly accessible metadata repositories describing the resources in the collections. In light of the well-known expansion of information in the life sciences and the need for metadata to enhance its value, these repositories present a potentially valuable new resource for application developers. Here we characterize the current contents of two scientifically relevant metadata repositories created through social tagging. This investigation helps to establish how such socially constructed metadata might be used as it stands currently and to suggest ways that new social tagging systems might be designed that would yield better aggregate products.RESULTS:We assessed the metadata that users of CiteULike and Connotea associated with citations in PubMed with the following metrics: coverage of the document space, density of metadata (tags) per document, rates of inter-annotator agreement, and rates of agreement with MeSH indexing. CiteULike and Connotea were very similar on all of the measurements. In comparison to PubMed, document coverage and per-document metadata density were much lower for the social tagging systems. Inter-annotator agreement within the social tagging systems and the agreement between the aggregated social tagging metadata and MeSH indexing was low though the latter could be increased through voting.CONCLUSION:The most promising uses of metadata from current academic social tagging repositories will be those that find ways to utilize the novel relationships between users, tags, and documents exposed through these systems. For more traditional kinds of indexing-based applications (such as keyword-based search) to benefit substantially from socially generated metadata in the life sciences, more documents need to be tagged and more tags are needed for each document. These issues may be addressed both by finding ways to attract more users to current systems and by creating new user interfaces that encourage more collectively useful individual tagging behaviour.},

Citation copying can explain not only why some misprints become popular, but also why some papers become highly cited. We show that a model where a scientist picks few random papers, cites them, and copies a fraction of their references accounts quantitatively for empirically observed distribution of citations.},

The service offers a systematic and comprehensive form of post-publication peer review that focuses on the best papers regardless of the journal in which they are published. It is now possible to draw some conclusions about how this new form of post-publication peer review meets the needs of scientists, and the organizations that fund them, in practice. In addition, inferences about the relative importance of journals are set out, which should also interest publishers and librarians.},

abstract = {Citebase is a new citation-ranked search and impact discovery service that measures citations of scholarly research papers which are openly accessible on the Web, i.e. papers that are assessable continuously online. Other services, such as ResearchIndex, have emerged in recent years to offer citation indexing of Web research papers. In the first detailed user evaluation of an open access Web citation indexing service, Citebase has been evaluated by nearly 200 users from different backgrounds. The paper details the procedures used in the evaluation, and analyses the results of this study, which took place between June and October 2002. It was found that within the scope of its primary components, the search interface and services available from its rich bibliographic records, Citebase can be used simply and reliably for the purpose intended, and that it compares favourably with other bibliographic services. It is shown tasks can be accomplished efficiently with Citebase regardless of the background of the user. More data need to be collected and the process refined before it is as reliable for measuring citation impact of indexed papers. Better explanations and guidance are required for first-time users. Coverage is seen as a limiting factor, even though Citebase indexes over 200,000 papers from arXiv. Non-physicists were frustrated at the lack of papers from other sciences. The principle of citation searching of open access archives has thus been demonstrated and need not be restricted to current users. Since the evaluation, Citebase has become a featured service of the ArXiv physics eprint archives.},

Tests with real usage data will be required to refine the definitions for these terms.* there is not a significant difference between authors in different areas of academic research on the validity of journal Impact Factors as a measure of quality* the great majority of authors in all fields of academic research would welcome a new, usage-based measure of the value of journals* UF, were it available, would be a highly ranked factor by librarians, not only in the evaluation of journals for potential purchase, but also in the evaluation of journals for retention or cancellation* publishers are, on the whole, unwilling to provide their usage data to a third party for consolidation and for calculation of UF. The majority appear to be willing to calculate UFs for their own journals and to have this process audited. This is generally perceived as a natural extension of the work already being done for COUNTER. While it may have implications for systems, these are not seen as being problematic.* COUNTER is on the whole trusted by librarians and publishers and is seen as having a role in the development and maintenance of UFs, possibly in partnership with another industry organization. Any organization filling this role must be trusted by both librarians and publishers and include representatives of publishers and librarians.* there are several structural problems with online usage data that would have to be addressed for UFs to be credible. Notable among these is the perception that online usage data is much more easily manipulated than is citation data.* should UKSG wish to take this project further there is a strong likelihood that other agencies would be interested in contributing financial support

Describes the state of the art of altmetrics, defined as the study, creation and use of measures related to user interaction with diverse research products through the Social Web – views, downloads, citations, reuse, sharing, tagging, comments, among others. To understand the context where altmetrics arises, we explore the Social Web’s specificities and potentials, and the characteristics of scientific communication. Besides being another step on the evolution of metric studies of information, altmetrics also presents itself as a reaction to the crisis in the current model of scientific publication and evaluation. Through an exploratory search in national and international sources we were able to identify the scientific literature about altmetrics, analysing the authors involved, its concepts, the proposals and trends around the theme, basing our reflection about the development of altmetrics and the acceptance of alternative metrics as tools for scientific evaluation. We note that altmetrics is an expanding area, and its methods complement traditional metrics contributing to a more complete understanding of scientific communication, its actors, processes, products and impacts.},

abstract = {he research production cycle has three components: the conduct of the research itself (R), the data (D), and the peer-reviewed publication (P) of the findings. Open Access (OA) means free online access to the publications (P-OA), but OA can also be extended to the data (D-OA). The two hurdles for D-OA are that not all researchers want to make their data OA and that the online infrastructure for D-OA still needs additional functionality. In contrast, all researchers, without exception, do want to make their publications P-OA, and the online infrastructure for publication-archiving (a worldwide interoperable network of OAI-compliant Institutional Repositories [IRs]) already has all the requisite functionality for this. Yet because so far only about 15\% of researchers are spontaneously self-archiving their publications today, their funders and institutions are beginning to mandate OA self-archiving in order to maximize the usage and impact of their research output. The adoption of these P-OA self-archiving mandates needs to be accelerated. Researchers’ careers and funding already depend on the impact (usage and citation) of their research. It has now been repeatedly demonstrated that making publications OA by self-archiving them in an OA IR dramatically enhances their research impact. Research metrics (e.g., download and citation counts) are increasingly being used to estimate and reward research impact, notably in the UK Research Assessment Exercise (RAE). But those metrics first need to be tested against human panel-based rankings in order to validate their predictive power. },

As social media plays an ever increasing role in the communication of scholarship, the authors will discuss how altmetrics can be a valuable addition to the information professionals tool kit. Beginning with a review of simple readership tools, and continuing with an overview of complex aggregator programs, the most promising and/or mature products will be described. Some of the many uses of altmetric data will be discussed, including the advantages of participating in large, diverse interest groups, informal reviews of formal documents, and the rapid (and arguably more complete) measure of research impact.

@article{Kousha2007,
abstract = {For a long time, Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) journal citations have been widely used for research performance monitoring of the sciences. For the social sciences, however, the Social Sciences Citation Index® (SSCI®) can sometimes be insufficient. Broader types of publications (e.g., books and non-ISI journals) and informal scholarly indicators may also be needed. This article investigates whether the Web can help to fill this gap. The authors analyzed 1530 citations from Google™ to 492 research articles from 44 open access social science journals. The articles were published in 2001 in the fields of education, psychology, sociology, and economics. About 19\% of the Web citations represented formal impact equivalent to journal citations, and 11\% were more informal indicators of impact. The average was about 3 formal and 2 informal impact citations per article. Although the proportions of formal and informal online impact were similar in sociology, psychology, and education, economics showed six times more formal impact than informal impact. The results suggest that new types of citation information and informal scholarly indictors could be extracted from the Web for the social sciences. Since these form only a small proportion of the Web citations, however, Web citation counts should first be processed to remove irrelevant citations. This can be a time-consuming process unless automated.},

The aim of the proposal is to increase the exposure of open access materials and their references to indexing services, and to motivate new services by reducing setup costs.

After implementation of a commercial Electronic Resources Management (ERM) system overwhelmed the librarians with access issues, they naturally formed a community of practice to initiate knowledge creation through developing a custom solution – the AurProblem Blog.

Observing these traces can inform new metrics of scholarly influence and impact - so-called "altmetrics." Stakeholders in academia are beginning to discuss how and where altmetrics can be useful towards evaluating a researcher's academic contribution. As this interest grows, libraries are in a unique position to help support an informed dialog on campus. We suggest that librarians can provide this support in three main ways: informing emerging conversations with the latest research, supporting experimentation with emerging altmetrics tools, and engaging in early altmetrics education and outreach. We include examples and lists of resources to help librarians fill these roles.},

We study three forms of reactions to these preprints: how they are downloaded on the arXiv.org site, how they are mentioned on the social media site Twitter, and how they are cited in the scholarly record. We perform two analyses. First, we analyze the delay and time span of article downloads and Twitter mentions following submission, to understand the temporal configuration of these reactions and whether significant differences exist between them. Second, we run correlation tests to investigate the relationship between Twitter mentions and both article downloads and article citations. We find that Twitter mentions follow rapidly after article submission and that they are correlated with later article downloads and later article citations, indicating that social media may be an important factor in determining the scientific impact of an article.},

We investigate the usefulness of Twitter in the development and distribution of scientific knowledge. At the start of the 'life cycle' of a scientific publication, Twitter provides a large virtual department of colleagues that can help to rapidly generate, share and refine new ideas. As ideas become manuscripts, Twitter can be used as an informal arena for the pre-review of works in progress. Finally, tweeting published findings can communicate research to a broad audience of other researchers, decision makers, journalists and the general public that can amplify the scientific and social impact of publications. However, there are limitations, largely surrounding issues of intellectual property and ownership, inclusiveness and misrepresentations of science ‘sound bites’. Nevertheless, we believe Twitter is a useful social media tool that can provide a valuable contribution to scientific publishing in the 21st century.},

@article{Weale2004c,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current methods of measuring the quality of journals assume that citations of articles within journals are normally distributed. Furthermore using journal impact factors to measure the quality of individual articles is flawed if citations are not uniformly spread between articles. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution of citations to articles and use the level of non-citation of articles within a journal as a measure of quality. This ranking method is compared with the impact factor, as calculated by ISI(R). METHODS: Total citations gained by October 2003, for every original article and review published in current immunology (13125 articles; 105 journals) and surgical (17083 articles; 120 journals) fields during 2001 were collected using ISI(R) Web of Science. RESULTS: The distribution of citation of articles within an individual journal is mainly non-parametric throughout the literature. One sixth (16.7\%; IQR 13.6-19.2) of articles in a journal accrue half the total number of citations to that journal. There was a broader distribution of citation to articles in higher impact journals and in the field of immunology compared to surgery. 23.7\% (IQR 14.6-42.4) of articles had not yet been cited. Levels of non-citation varied between journals and subject fields. There was a significant negative correlation between the proportion of articles never cited and a journal's impact factor for both immunology (rho = -0.854) and surgery journals (rho = -0.924). CONCLUSION: Ranking journals by impact factor and non-citation produces similar results. Using a non-citation rate is advantageous as it creates a clear distinction between how citation analysis is used to determine the quality of a journal (low level of non-citation) and an individual article (citation counting). Non-citation levels should therefore be made available for all journals.},

@article{Piwowar2013b,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Attribution to the original contributor upon reuse of published data is important both as a reward for data creators and to document the provenance of research findings. Previous studies have found that papers with publicly available datasets receive a higher number of citations than similar studies without available data. However, few previous analyses have had the statistical power to control for the many variables known to predict citation rate, which has led to uncertain estimates of the “citation boost”. Furthermore, little is known about patterns in data reuse over time and across datasets. METHOD AND RESULTS: Here, we look at citation rates while controlling for many known citation predictors, and investigate the variability of data reuse. In a multivariate regression on 10,555 studies that created gene expression microarray data, we found that studies that made data available in a public repository received 9\% (95\% confidence interval: 5\% to 13\%) more citations than similar studies for which the data was not made available. Date of publication, journal impact factor, open access status, number of authors, first and last author publication history, corresponding author country, institution citation history, and study topic were included as covariates. The citation boost varied with date of dataset deposition: a citation boost was most clear for papers published in 2004 and 2005, at about 30\%. Authors published most papers using their own datasets within two years of their first publication on the dataset, whereas data reuse papers published by third-party investigators continued to accumulate for at least six years. To study patterns of data reuse directly, we compiled 9,724 instances of third party data reuse via mention of GEO or ArrayExpress accession numbers in the full text of papers. The level of third-party data use was high: for 100 datasets deposited in year 0, we estimated that 40 papers in PubMed reused a dataset by year 2, 100 by year 4, and more than 150 data reuse papers had been published by year 5. Data reuse was distributed across a broad base of datasets: a very conservative estimate found that 20\% of the datasets deposited between 2003 and 2007 had been reused at least once by third parties. CONCLUSION: After accounting for other factors affecting citation rate, we find a robust citation benefit from open data, although a smaller one than previously reported. We conclude there is a direct effect of third-party data reuse that persists for years beyond the time when researchers have published most of the papers reusing their own data. Other factors that may also contribute to the citation boost are considered. We further conclude that, at least for gene expression microarray data, a substantial fraction of archived datasets are reused, and that the intensity of dataset reuse has been steadily increasing since 2003.},

abstract = {The growth rate of scientific publication has been studied from 1907 to 2007 using available data from a number of literature databases, including Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI). Traditional scientific publishing, that is publication in peer-reviewed journals, is still increasing although there are big differences between fields. There are no indications that the growth rate has decreased in the last 50 years. At the same time publication using new channels, for example conference proceedings, open archives and home pages, is growing fast. The growth rate for SCI up to 2007 is smaller than for comparable databases. This means that SCI was covering a decreasing part of the traditional scientific literature. There are also clear indications that the coverage by SCI is especially low in some of the scientific areas with the highest growth rate, including computer science and engineering sciences. The role of conference proceedings, open access archives and publications published on the net is increasing, especially in scientific fields with high growth rates, but this has only partially been reflected in the databases. The new publication channels challenge the use of the big databases in measurements of scientific productivity or output and of the growth rate of science. Because of the declining coverage and this challenge it is problematic that SCI has been used and is used as the dominant source for science indicators based on publication and citation numbers. The limited data available for social sciences show that the growth rate in SSCI was remarkably low and indicate that the coverage by SSCI was declining over time. National Science Indicators from Thomson Reuters is based solely on SCI, SSCI and Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI). Therefore the declining coverage of the citation databases problematizes the use of this source.},

abstract = {Experimental evaluation and comparison of techniques, algorithms, approaches or complete systems is a crucial requirement to assess the practical impact of research results. The quality of published experimental results is usually limited due to several reasons such as: limited time, unavailability of standard benchmarks or shortage of computing resources. Moreover, achieving an independent, consistent, complete and insightful assessment for different alternatives in the same domain is a time and resource consuming task in addition to its requirement to be periodically repeated to maintain its freshness and being up-to-date. In this paper, we coin the notion of Liquid Benchmarks as online and public services that provide collaborative platforms to unify efforts of peer researchers from all over the world to simplify their task in performing high quality experimental evaluations and guarantee a transparent scientific crediting process.},

From deciding what to read based on tweets, to enhancing scholarship with collaboration, altmetrics will exert more and more influence on the scholarly landscape. Awareness of altmetric tools, and the ways in which they can be used, will position information professionals at the forefront of this exciting new era in knowledge dissemination and assessment. As social media plays an ever increasing role in the communication of scholarship, the authors will discuss how altmetrics can be a valuable addition to the information professional’s tool kit. Beginning with a review of simple readership tools, and continuing with an overview of complex aggregator programs, the most promising and/or mature products will be described. Some of the many uses of altmetric data will be discussed, including the advantages of participating in large, diverse interest groups, informal reviews of formal documents, and the rapid (and arguably more complete) measure of research impact. The authors will further demonstrate how to use altmetrics to complement and enhance existing methods to provide readership advisory services for ourselves and our patrons, facilitate knowledge sharing, indicate effectiveness, and supply evidence for promotion and tenure.},

abstract = {Can altmetric data be validly used for the measurement of societal impact? The current study seeks to answer this question with a comprehensive dataset (about 100,000 records) from very disparate sources (F1000, Altmetric, and an in-house database based on Web of Science). In the F1000 peer review system, experts attach particular tags to scientific papers which indicate whether a paper could be of interest for science or rather for other segments of society. The results show that papers with the tag "good for teaching" do achieve higher altmetric counts than papers without this tag - if the quality of the papers is controlled. At the same time, a higher citation count is shown especially by papers with a tag that is specifically scientifically oriented ("new finding"). The findings indicate that papers tailored for a readership outside the area of research should lead to societal impact. If altmetric data is to be used for the measurement of societal impact, the question arises of its normalization. In bibliometrics, citations are normalized for the papers' subject area and publication year. This study has taken a second analytic step involving a possible normalization of altmetric data. As the results show there are particular scientific topics which are of especial interest for a wide audience. Since these more or less interesting topics are not completely reflected in Thomson Reuters' journal sets, a normalization of altmetric data should not be based on the level of subject categories, but on the level of topics.},

Usage-based metrics offer a new avenue to scientific quality assessment but face the same risks as first generation search engines that used unreliable metrics (such as raw traffic data) to estimate content quality. In this article I analyze the contribution that social bookmarking systems can provide to the problem of usage-based metrics for scientific evaluation. I suggest that collaboratively aggregated metadata may help fill the gap between traditional citation-based criteria and raw usage factors. I submit that bottom-up, distributed evaluation models such as those afforded by social bookmarking will challenge more traditional quality assessment models in terms of coverage, efficiency and scalability. Services aggregating user-related quality indicators for online scientific content will come to occupy a key function in the scholarly communication system.},

abstract = {The revolution in scientific publishing that has been promised since the 1980s is about to take place. Scientists have always read strategically, working with many articles simultaneously to search, filter, scan, link, annotate, and analyze fragments of content. An observed recent increase in strategic reading in the online environment will soon be further intensified by two current trends: (i) the widespread use of digital indexing, retrieval, and navigation resources and (ii) the emergence within many scientific disciplines of interoperable ontologies. Accelerated and enhanced by reading tools that take advantage of ontologies, reading practices will become even more rapid and indirect, transforming the ways in which scientists engage the literature and shaping the evolution of scientific publishing.},

The report therefore advises to start a concerted research programme in the dynamics, properties, and potential use of new web based metrics which relates these new measures to the already established indicators of publication impact. Its goal would be to contribute to the development of more useful tools for the scientific and scholarly community. This programme should monitor at least the following tools: F1000, Microsoft Academic Research, Total-Impact, PlosONE altmetrics, and Google Scholar. The programme should moreover develop the following key research themes: concepts of new web metrics and altmetrics; standardisation of tools and data; and the use and normalisation of the new metrics.},

The management approach to patients with suspected or proven bacterial meningitis includes emergent cerebrospinal fluid analysis and initiation of appropriate antimicrobial and adjunctive therapies. The choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy is based on the patient's age and underlying disease status; once the infecting pathogen is isolated, antimicrobial therapy can be modified for optimal treatment. Successful treatment of bacterial meningitis requires the knowledge on epidemiology including prevalence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens, pathogenesis of meningitis, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimicrobial agents. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains in recent years has necessitated the development of new strategies for empiric antimicrobial therapy for bacterial meningitis.},

abstract = {Open access (OA) to the research literature has the potential to accelerate recognition and dissemination of research findings, but its actual effects are controversial. This was a longitudinal bibliometric analysis of a cohort of OA and non-OA articles published between June 8, 2004, and December 20, 2004, in the same journal (PNAS: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences). Article characteristics were extracted, and citation data were compared between the two groups at three different points in time: at "quasi-baseline" (December 2004, 0-6 mo after publication), in April 2005 (4-10 mo after publication), and in October 2005 (10-16 mo after publication). Potentially confounding variables, including number of authors, authors' lifetime publication count and impact, submission track, country of corresponding author, funding organization, and discipline, were adjusted for in logistic and linear multiple regression models. A total of 1,492 original research articles were analyzed: 212 (14.2\% of all articles) were OA articles paid by the author, and 1,280 (85.8\%) were non-OA articles. In April 2005 (mean 206 d after publication), 627 (49.0\%) of the non-OA articles versus 78 (36.8\%) of the OA articles were not cited (relative risk = 1.3 [95\% Confidence Interval: 1.1-1.6]; p = 0.001). 6 mo later (mean 288 d after publication), non-OA articles were still more likely to be uncited (non-OA: 172 [13.6\%], OA: 11 [5.2\%]; relative risk = 2.6 [1.4-4.7]; p < 0.001). The average number of citations of OA articles was higher compared to non-OA articles (April 2005: 1.5 [SD = 2.5] versus 1.2 [SD = 2.0]; Z = 3.123; p = 0.002; October 2005: 6.4 [SD = 10.4] versus 4.5 [SD = 4.9]; Z = 4.058; p < 0.001). In a logistic regression model, controlling for potential confounders, OA articles compared to non-OA articles remained twice as likely to be cited (odds ratio = 2.1 [1.5-2.9]) in the first 4-10 mo after publication (April 2005), with the odds ratio increasing to 2.9 (1.5-5.5) 10-16 mo after publication (October 2005). Articles published as an immediate OA article on the journal site have higher impact than self-archived or otherwise openly accessible OA articles. We found strong evidence that, even in a journal that is widely available in research libraries, OA articles are more immediately recognized and cited by peers than non-OA articles published in the same journal. OA is likely to benefit science by accelerating dissemination and uptake of research findings.},

abstract = {Large amounts of veterinary medicines are widely used as therapeutic drugs and feed additives (growth promoters) in China, the environmental presence of which possibly poses challenges to the environment and human health. Therefore, it is important to list the veterinary medicines that are considered to be of relatively high priority in China for environmental management. In this study, a three-stage prioritization scheme was applied to veterinary medicines in China. In Stage I, exposure assessment was conducted based on usage amounts and the possibility of entering the environment. In Stage II, the ecotoxicity and human health effects of compounds having a high potential to enter the environment were assessed. In Stage III, considering both the results of Stages I and II, veterinary medicines were assigned into four priority classifications. Using the approach, 38 compounds were assigned to "H," 7 compounds to "M," 2 compounds to "L," and 22 compounds to "VL." Among the top-ranked compounds, antibiotics, endoparasiticides, and aquacultural medicines accounted for 57.9\%, 28.9\%, and 10.5\%, respectively. Insecticides used widely in China's aquaculture need to be taken into account due to their high priority rank. This is the first study on the prioritization of veterinary pharmaceuticals in China. © 2014 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

Alternative metrics more accurately measure the impact of scholarly writings, better serve all scholars and can foster a research culture that supports national development goals. The current system favors dominant journals and topics of interest to the prevailing scientific community, captured by the leading bibliographic databases. Yet publishing on platforms more open to underrepresented journals and scholars in developing nations would promote a greater range of ideas and scholarly exchange. With facilitating international development in mind, scholarly communication should encourage research on topics of local and national relevance and be presented through globally accessible channels, disseminated by social media. Publishing technology barriers to participation must be lowered. The value of altmetrics will be evident, providing advantages to alternative scholars, serving public needs and revealing scientific contributions long underrepresented in the standard literature.},

abstract = {Altmetrics, indices based on social media platforms and tools, have recently emerged as alternative means of measuring scholarly impact. Such indices assume that scholars in fact populate online social environments, and interact with scholarly products there. We tested this assumption by examining the use and coverage of social media environments amongst a sample of bibliometricians. As expected, coverage varied: 82\% of articles published by sampled bibliometricians were included in Mendeley libraries, while only 28\% were included in CiteULike. Mendeley bookmarking was moderately correlated (.45) with Scopus citation. Over half of respondents asserted that social media tools were affecting their professional lives, although uptake of online tools varied widely. 68\% of those surveyed had LinkedIn accounts, while Academia.edu, Mendeley, and ResearchGate each claimed a fifth of respondents. Nearly half of those responding had Twitter accounts, which they used both personally and professionally. Surveyed bibliometricians had mixed opinions on altmetrics' potential; 72\% valued download counts, while a third saw potential in tracking articles' influence in blogs, Wikipedia, reference managers, and social media. Altogether, these findings suggest that some online tools are seeing substantial use by bibliometricians, and that they present a potentially valuable source of impact data.},

Design/methodology/approach – After a literature review of the available resources (academic literature, journal articles, white papers, popular media and books) the benefits and perceived risks associated with electronic social networking on organisations are investigated. Findings – An individual's success in society depends on the shape and size of his/her social network and ability to network and form connections with other social groups. Organisations which can harness this innate human ability to manage knowledge will be able to lower transactions costs and become more profitable. Originality/value – The paper increases the understanding of what electronic social networking encompasses and how it can be utilised for business purposes. The ideas and discussion put forth are equally applicable to libraries and may give them new insights into the provision of social networking applications as part of their services to users.

abstract = {The rise of the social web and its uptake by scholars has led to the creation of altmetrics, which are social web metrics for academic publications. These new metrics can, in theory, be used in an evaluative role, to give early estimates of the impact of publications or to give estimates of non-traditional types of impact. They can also be used as an information seeking aid: to help draw a digital library users attention to papers that have attracted social web mentions. If altmetrics are to be trusted then they must be evaluated to see if the claims made about them are reasonable. Drawing upon previous citation analysis debates and web citation analysis research, this article discusses altmetric evaluation strategies, including correlation tests, content analyses, interviews and pragmatic analyses. It recommends that a range of methods are needed for altmetric evaluations, that the methods should focus on identifying the relative strengths of influences on altmetric creation, and that such evaluations should be prioritised in a logical order.},

However, there is little research com- bining the tools to study communication behaviour and communication content, namely, social network analysis and content analysis. Furthermore, there is even less work addressing the longitudinal characteris- tics of such a combination.

abstract = {Altmetric measurements derived from the social web are increasingly advocated and used as early indicators of article impact and usefulness. Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic scientific evidence that altmetrics are valid proxies of either impact or utility although a few case studies have reported medium correlations between specific altmetrics and citation rates for individual journals or fields. To fill this gap, this study compares 11 altmetrics with Web of Science citations for 76 to 208,739 PubMed articles with at least one altmetric mention in each case and up to 1,891 journals per metric. It also introduces a simple sign test to overcome biases caused by different citation and usage windows. Statistically significant associations were found between higher metric scores and higher citations for articles with positive altmetric scores in all cases with sufficient evidence (Twitter, Facebook wall posts, research highlights, blogs, mainstream media and forums) except perhaps for Google+ posts. Evidence was insufficient for LinkedIn, Pinterest, question and answer sites, and Reddit, and no conclusions should be drawn about articles with zero altmetric scores or the strength of any correlation between altmetrics and citations. Nevertheless, comparisons between citations and metric values for articles published at different times, even within the same year, can remove or reverse this association and so publishers and scientometricians should consider the effect of time when using altmetrics to rank articles. Finally, the coverage of all the altmetrics except for Twitter seems to be low and so it is not clear if they are prevalent enough to be useful in practice.},

This concept raises from the development of new indicators based on Web 2.0, for the evaluation of the research and academic activity. The basic assumption is that variables such as mentions in blogs, number of twits or of researchers bookmarking a research paper for instance, may be legitimate indicators for measuring the use and impact of scientific publications. In this sense, these indicators are currently the focus of the bibliometric community and are being discussed and debated. We describe the main platforms and indicators and we analyze as a sample the Spanish research output in Communication Studies. Comparing traditional indicators such as citations with these new indicators. The results show that the most cited papers are also the ones with a highest impact according to the altmetrics. We conclude pointing out the main shortcomings these metrics present and the role they may play when measuring the research impact through 2.0 platforms.},

The authors evaluated two document access models based on the work of Anderson and Schooler. The first is based on how frequently a document was accessed. The second is based on both frequency and recency.ResultsThe model based only on frequency of past access was highly correlated with the empirical data (R(2)=0.932), whereas the model based on frequency and recency had a much lower correlation (R(2)=0.668).DiscussionThe frequency-only model accurately predicted whether a document will be accessed based on past use. Modeling accesses as a function of frequency requires storing only the number of accesses and the creation date for the document. This model requires low storage overheads and is computationally efficient, making it scalable to large corpora such as MEDLINE.ConclusionIt is feasible to accurately model the probability of a document being accessed in the future based on past accesses.},

The emergence and expansion of new technologies and internet-based tools is leading to new means to improve scientific methodology and communication, assessment, promotion and certification. It allows methods of acquisition, manipulation and storage, generating vast quantities of data that can further facilitate the research process. It also improves access to scientific results through information sharing and discussion. Content previously restricted only to specialists is now available to a wider audience. This context requires new management systems to make scientific knowledge more accessible and useable, including new measures to evaluate the reach of scientific information. The new science and research quality measures are strongly related to the new online technologies and services based in social media. Tools such as blogs, social bookmarks and online reference managers, Twitter and others offer alternative, transparent and more comprehensive information about the active interest, usage and reach of scientific publications. Another of these new filters is the Research Blogging platform, which was created in 2007 and now has over 1,230 active blogs, with over 26,960 entries posted about peer-reviewed research on subjects ranging from Anthropology to Zoology. This study takes a closer look at RB, in order to get insights into its contribution to the rapidly changing landscape of scientific communication.},

abstract = {Financial market prediction on the basis of online sentiment tracking has drawn a lot of attention recently. However, most results in this emerging domain rely on a unique, particular combination of data sets and sentiment tracking tools. This makes it difficult to disambiguate measurement and instrument effects from factors that are actually involved in the apparent relation between online sentiment and market values. In this paper, we survey a range of online data sets (Twitter feeds, news headlines, and volumes of Google search queries) and sentiment tracking methods (Twitter Investor Sentiment, Negative News Sentiment and Tweet \& Google Search volumes of financial terms), and compare their value for financial prediction of market indices such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, trading volumes, and market volatility (VIX), as well as gold prices. We also compare the predictive power of traditional investor sentiment survey data, i.e. Investor Intelligence and Daily Sentiment Index, against those of the mentioned set of online sentiment indicators. Our results show that traditional surveys of Investor Intelligence are lagging indicators of the financial markets. However, weekly Google Insight Search volumes on financial search queries do have predictive value. An indicator of Twitter Investor Sentiment and the frequency of occurrence of financial terms on Twitter in the previous 1-2 days are also found to be very statistically significant predictors of daily market log return. Survey sentiment indicators are however found not to be statistically significant predictors of financial market values, once we control for all other mood indicators as well as the VIX.},

Unfounded authority was established by citation bias against papers that refuted or weakened the belief; amplification, the marked expansion of the belief system by papers presenting no data addressing it; and forms of invention such as the conversion of hypothesis into fact through citation alone. Extension of this network into text within grants funded by the National Institutes of Health and obtained through the Freedom of Information Act showed the same phenomena present and sometimes used to justify requests for funding.  Conclusion Citation is both an impartial scholarly method and a powerful form of social communication. Through distortions in its social use that include bias, amplification, and invention, citation can be used to generate information cascades resulting in unfounded authority of claims. Construction and analysis of a claim specific citation network may clarify the nature of a published belief system and expose distorted methods of social citation. 10.1136/bmj.b2680},

abstract = {Articles whose authors have supplemented subscription-based access to the publisher's version by self-archiving their own final draft to make it accessible free for all on the web ("Open Access", OA) are cited significantly more than articles in the same journal and year that have not been made OA. Some have suggested that this "OA Advantage" may not be causal but just a self-selection bias, because authors preferentially make higher-quality articles OA. To test this we compared self-selective self-archiving with mandatory self-archiving for a sample of 27,197 articles published 2002-2006 in 1,984 journals. METHDOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The OA Advantage proved just as high for both. Logistic regression analysis showed that the advantage is independent of other correlates of citations (article age; journal impact factor; number of co-authors, references or pages; field; article type; or country) and highest for the most highly cited articles. The OA Advantage is real, independent and causal, but skewed. Its size is indeed correlated with quality, just as citations themselves are (the top 20\% of articles receive about 80\% of all citations).},

@article{Harnad2005,
abstract = {The OA impact advantage arises from at least the following 6 component factors, three of them (2,3,5) temporary, three of them permanent (1,4,6): 1. EA: EARLY ADVANTAGE, beginning already at the pre-refereeing preprint stage. Research that is reported earlier can begin being used and built upon earlier. The result turns out to be not just that it gets its quota of citations sooner, but that quota actually goes up, permanently. This is probably because earlier uptake has a greater cumulative effect on the research cycle. 2. (AA): ARXIV ADVANTAGE, the special advantage of self-archiving specifically in Arxiv for physicists, because it is a central point of call: OAI-interoperable Institutional Repositories is likely -- for many reasons -- to supersede this, so it will eventually make zero difference which OAI-compliant IR one deposits in, as access will be through OAI cross-archive harvesters, not directly through individual OAI Archives. 3. (QB): QUALITY BIAS, arsing from article/author self-selection; this does not play a causal role in increasing impact: The higher-quality (hence also higher-impact) articles/authors are somewhat more likely to be self-archived/self-archivers in these early (15\%) days of self-archiving: this bias will of course vanish as self-archiving approaches 100\%).  4. QA: QUALITY ADVANTAGE, allowing the high-quality articles to compete on a level playing field, freed of current handicaps and biasses arising from access affordability differences. A permanent effect. 5. (CA): COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, for self-archived papers over non-self-archived ones, in early (15\%) days; this too will of course disappear once self-archiving nears 100\%, but at this moment it is in fact a powerful extra incentive, for the low \% self-archiving fields, institutions and individuals. 6. UA: USAGE ADVANTAGE: OA articles are downloaded and read three times as much. This too is a permanent effect. (There is also a sizeable correlation between early download counts and later citation counts.) },

abstract = {Although there are a number of social networking services that specifically target scholars, little has been published about the actual practices and the usage of these so-called academic social networking services (ASNSs). To fill this gap, we explore the populations of academics who engage in social activities using an ASNS; as an indicator of further engagement, we also determine their various motivations for joining a group in ASNSs. Using groups and their members in Mendeley as the platform for our case study, we obtained 146 participant responses from our online survey about users' common activities, usage habits, and motivations for joining groups. Our results show that 1) participants did not engage with social-based features as frequently and actively as they engaged with research-based features, and 2) users who joined more groups seemed to have a stronger motivation to increase their professional visibility and to contribute the research articles they had read to the group reading list. Our results generate interesting insights into Mendeley's user populations, their activities, and their motivations relative to the social features of Mendeley. We also argue that further design of ASNSs is needed to take greater account of disciplinary differences in scholarly communication and to establish incentive mechanisms for encouraging user participation.},

Both Mendeley user counts and F1000 article factors (FFas) correlate significantly with citation counts and associated Journal Impact Factors. However, the correlations for Mendeley user counts are much larger than those for FFas. It may be that F1000 is good at disclosing the merit of an article from an expert practitioner point of view while Mendeley user counts may be more closely related to traditional citation impact. Articles that attract exceptionally many citations are generally disorder or disease related, while those with extremely high social bookmark user counts are mainly historical or introductory.},

abstract = {The present work has calculated the minimum Open Archive Impact Factors and Open Archive Immediacy Index for the Physics Classes of arXiv.org as calculated for traditional journals in Journal Citation Reports of the Institute of Scientific Information using Science Citation Index without the citation by the classes itself. The calculated Impact Factors reveal that High-Energy Physics classes of arXiv.org (?hep-th?, ?hep-lat?, ?hep-ex?, and ?hep-ph?) have made more impact on the scientific community than any other classes except ?nucl-ex?. The Impact Factors for the year 2003 are: ?hep-th? (0.999), ?nucl-ex? (0.806), ?hep-lat? (0.766), ?hep-ex? (0.73), ?hep-ph? (0.719), ?nucl-th? (0.338), ?quant-ph? (0.334), ?cond-mat? (0.313), ?astro-ph? (0.195), ?math-ph? (0.162), ?physics? (0.061), and ?gr-qc? (0.002). If the period for getting the citations to the open archive classes is considered one year as against two years for journal articles, the rank of the classes is the same. The immediacy of citing the Open Archives is also high for the High-Energy Physics classes. The Immediacy Indexes for the year 2003 are: ?hep-ex? (0.619), ?hep-th? (0.454), ?hep-ph? (0.44), ?hep-lat? (0.263), ?nucl-ex? (0.238), ?quant-ph? (0.202), ?nucl-th? (0.185), ?cond-mat? (0.168), ?astro-ph? (0.094), ?math-ph? (0.075), ?physics? (0.03), and ?gr-qc? (0.002). The impact is definitely much higher than what is concluded from the calculated factors because self-citations are not reckoned in the study.

Five documents from each repository are searched in ten search engines/data discovery tools (OAIster, Scirus, Google, MSN, Yahoo, All the Web, Ask, Altavista, AOL and Gigablast) for determining the visibility of repositories. The documents from each repository are selected randomly using the function sample (?) of R software. Findings – None of the repositories in the study are fully interoperable (the visibility of repositories in search engines/data discovery tools range from 4 per cent to 92 per cent). OAI-PMH compliance enhances the visibility of the repositories considerably. Google and MSN retrieved the highest number of documents from the repositories and Gigablast the least.

These metrics have recently been adopted by Thomson Reuters and are listed alongside the Impact Factor in the Journal Citation Reports. But do these metrics differ sufficiently so as to be a useful addition to the bibliometric toolbox? Davis (2008) has argued that they do not, based on his finding of a 0.95 correlation coefficient between Eigenfactor score and Total Citations for a sample of journals in the field of medicine. This conclusion is mistaken; in this article, we illustrate the basic statistical fallacy to which Davis succumbed. We provide a complete analysis of the 2006 Journal Citation Reports and demonstrate that there are statistically and economically significant differences between the information provided by the Eigenfactor Metrics and that provided by Impact Factor and Total Citations.},

It has evolved from the trends that social media found its use in research and that the movement toward open access accelerated online dissemination of scholarly information. Researchers shifted their venues of professional communications and research workflow to the Web. Created to meet the needs of the Web Age, “altmetrics” will allow article-level, real-time measures of research impact but not citations, using social media. Being still at an early stage, “altmetrics” have the potential to develop as new complements to traditional metrics through tools development and Twitter-based citation projections. To become popular, these new metrics would need to work together with open access for mutual harmony and benefit. This paper overviews the emergence, present situation, relationship with both social media and open access, and opportunities of “altmetrics”.},

These citations are part of a conversation which moves faster than traditional citations but still reflects scholarly impact.

abstract = {A broad-scale quantification of the measure of quality for scholarship is under way. This trend has fundamental implications for the future of academic publishing and employment. In this essay we want to raise questions about these burgeoning practices, particularly how they affect philosophy of education and similar sub-disciplines. First, details are given of how an 'impact factor' is calculated. The various meanings that can be attached to it are scrutinised. Second, we examine how impact factors are used to make various 'high stakes' academic decisions, such as hiring and promotion, funding of research projects and how much money is to be awarded to a particular area. By focusing on a particular practice, problems with the application of the metric generally are outlined. Finally, we offer some general observations about the unintended consequences and other problems arising from the widespread use of this metric, including attempts to 'game the system'. We argue that the use of impact factors increasingly shapes the kind of topics and issues scholars write on, their choices of methodology, and their choice of publication venues for their work. Technical measures and mechanisms tend to 'colonise' the qualitative and professional judgments that must also be part of the process of evaluation, and for which bibliometrics alone cannot offer a substitute.},

One side effect of impact factors is the incentive they create for editors to coerce authors to add citations to their journal. Coercive self-citation does not refer to the normal citation directions, given during a peer-review process, meant to improve a paper. Coercive self-citation refers to requests that (i) give no indication that the manuscript was lacking in attribution; (ii) make no suggestion as to specific articles, authors, or a body of work requiring review; and (iii) only guide authors to add citations from the editor's journal. This quote from an editor as a condition for publication highlights the problem: “you cite Leukemia [once in 42 references]. Consequently, we kindly ask you to add references of articles published in Leukemia to your present article” (6).

For this purpose, a random sample of F1000 medical articles from the years 2007 and 2008 were studied. In seven out of the nine cases, there were no significant differences between the article types in terms of citation counts and FFa scores. Nevertheless, citation counts and FFa scores were significantly different for two article types: “New finding” and “Changes clinical practice”: FFa scores value the appropriateness of medical research for clinical practice and “New finding” articles are more highly cited. It seems that highlighting key features of medical articles alongside ratings by Faculty members of F1000 could help to reveal the hidden value of some medical papers.},

abstract = {The presence of web-based communities is a distinctive signature of Web 2.0. The web-based feature means that information propagation within each community is highly facilitated, promoting complex collective dynamics in view of information exchange. In this work, we focus on a community of scientists and study, in particular, how the awareness of a scientific paper is spread. Our work is based on the web usage statistics obtained from the PLoS Article Level Metrics dataset compiled by PLoS. The cumulative number of HTML views was found to follow a long tail distribution which is reasonably well-fitted by a lognormal one. We modeled the diffusion of information by a random multiplicative process, and thus extracted the rates of information spread at different stages after the publication of a paper. We found that the spread of information displays two distinct decay regimes: a rapid downfall in the first month after publication, and a gradual power law decay afterwards. We identified these two regimes with two distinct driving processes: a short-term behavior driven by the fame of a paper, and a long-term behavior consistent with citation statistics. The patterns of information spread were found to be remarkably similar in data from different journals, but there are intrinsic differences for different types of web usage (HTML views and PDF downloads versus XML). These similarities and differences shed light on the theoretical understanding of different complex systems, as well as a better design of the corresponding web applications that is of high potential marketing impact.},

annote = {Publishing and bibliometric indicators are of utmost relevance for scientists and research institutions as the impact or importance of a publication (or even of a scientist or an institution) is mostly regarded to be equivalent to a citation-based indicator, e.g. in form of the Journal Impact Factor or the Hirsch-Index. Both on an individual and an institutional level performance measurement depends strongly on these impact scores. This contribution shows that most common methods to assess the impact of scientific publications often discriminate Open Access publications ? and by that reduce the attractiveness of Open Access for scientists. Assuming that the motivation to use Open Access publishing services (e.g. a journal or a repository) would increase if these services would convey some sort of reputation or impact to the scientists, alternative models of impact are discussed. Prevailing research results indicate that alternative metrics based on usage information of electronic documents are suitable to complement or to relativize citation-based indicators. Furthermore an insight into the project OpenAccess- Statistics OA-S is given. OA-S implemented an infrastructure to collect document-related usage information from distributed Open Access Repositories in an aggregator service in order to generate interoperable document access information according to three standards (COUNTER, LogEc and IFABC). The service also guarantees the deduplication of users and identical documents on different servers. In a second phase it is not only planned to implement added services like recommender},

abstract = {The design of a publisher's electronic interface can have a measurable effect on electronic journal usage statistics. A study of journal usage from six COUNTER-compliant publishers at 32 research institutions in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Sweden indicates that the ratio of PDF to HTML views is not consistent across publisher interfaces, even after controlling for differences in publisher content. The number of full-text downloads may be artificially inflated when publishers require users to view HTML versions before accessing PDF versions or when linking mechanisms, such as CrossRef, direct users to the full text rather than the abstract of each article. These results suggest that usage reports from COUNTER-compliant publishers are not directly comparable in their current form. One solution may be to modify publisher numbers with \&ldquo;adjustment factors\&rdquo; deemed to be representative of the benefit or disadvantage due to its interface. Standardization of some interface and linking protocols may obviate these differences and allow for more accurate cross-publisher comparisons. \&copy; 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {The research access/impact problem arises because journal articles are not accessible to all of their would-be users; hence, they are losing potential research impact. The solution is to make all articles open access (OA, i.e., accessible online, free for all). OA articles have significantly higher citation impact than non-OA articles. There are two roads to OA: the 'golden' road (publish your article in an OA journal) and the 'green' road (publish your article in a non-OA journal but also self-archive it in an OA archive). About 10\% of journals are gold, but over 90\% are already green (i.e., they have given their authors the green light to self-archive); yet only about 10-20\% of articles have been self-archived. To reach 100\% OA, self-archiving needs to be mandated by researchers' employers and funders, as they are now increasingly beginning to do.},

abstract = {Historically, papers have been physically bound to the journal in which they were published but in the electronic age papers are available individually, no longer tied to their respective journals. Hence, papers now can be read and cited based on their own merits, independently of the journal's physical availability, reputation, or Impact Factor. We compare the strength of the relationship between journals' Impact Factors and the actual citations received by their respective papers from 1902 to 2009. Throughout most of the 20th century, papers' citation rates were increasingly linked to their respective journals' Impact Factors. However, since 1990, the advent of the digital age, the strength of the relation between Impact Factors and paper citations has been decreasing. This decrease began sooner in physics, a field that was quicker to make the transition into the electronic domain. Furthermore, since 1990, the proportion of highly cited papers coming from highly cited journals has been decreasing, and accordingly, the proportion of highly cited papers not coming from highly cited journals has also been increasing. Should this pattern continue, it might bring an end to the use of the Impact Factor as a way to evaluate the quality of journals, papers and researchers.},

Moreover papers are expected to retain this advantage in perpetuity -- they should receive more citations indefinitely, no matter how many other papers are published after them. We test this conjecture against data from a selection of fields and in several cases find a first-mover effect of a magnitude similar to that predicted by the theory. Were we wearing our cynical hat today, we might say that the scientist who wants to become famous is better off -- by a wide margin -- writing a modest paper in next year's hottest field than an outstanding paper in this year's. On the other hand, there are some papers, albeit only a small fraction, that buck the trend and attract significantly more citations than theory predicts despite having relatively late publication dates. We suggest that papers of this kind, though they often receive comparatively few citations overall, are probably worthy of our attention.},

Ranking these new venues is imperative to assist researchers, librarians, and research institutions. However, rankings based on traditional citation-based metrics have limitations and are no longer the only or the best choice to determine the impact of scholarly venues. Here, we propose a venue-ranking approach based on scholarly references from academic social media sites, and we compare a number of citation-based rankings with social-based rankings. Our preliminary results show a statistically significant correlation between the two approaches in a number of general rankings, research areas, and subdisciplines. Furthermore, we found that social-based rankings favor open-access venues over venues that require a subscription.},

Data generated from social media activities related to scholarly content can be used to reflect broad types of impact. This paper aims to provide systematic evidence regarding how often Twitter is used to diffuse journal articles in the biomedical and life sciences. The analysis is based on a set of 1.4 million documents covered by both PubMed and Web of Science (WoS) and published between 2010 and 2012. The number of tweets containing links to these documents was analyzed to evaluate the degree to which certain journals, disciplines, and specialties were represented on Twitter. It is shown that, with less than 10\% of PubMed articles mentioned on Twitter, its uptake is low in general. The relationship between tweets and WoS citations was examined for each document at the level of journals and specialties. The results show that tweeting behavior varies between journals and specialties and correlations between tweets and citations are low, implying that impact metrics based on tweets are different from those based on citations. A framework utilizing the coverage of articles and the correlation between Twitter mentions and citations is proposed to facilitate the evaluation of novel social-media based metrics and to shed light on the question in how far the number of tweets is a valid metric to measure research impact.},

We further show that a machine learning classifier, based only on coauthorship network centrality measures at time of publication, is able to predict with high precision whether an article will be highly cited five years after publication. By this we provide quantitative insight into the social dimension of scientific publishing - challenging the perception of citations as an objective, socially unbiased measure of scientific success.},

For the 21st century we need not just information on science, but also meta-level scientific information that is delivered to the digital workbench of every researcher. Access, usage and citation metrics will be one major information service that researchers will need on an everyday basis to handle the complexity of science.Scientometrics has been built on centralised commercial databases of high functionality but restricted scope, mainly providing information that may be used for research assessment. Enter digital libraries and repositories: Can they collect reliable metadata at source, ensure universal metric coverage and defray costs? This systematic appraisal of the future role of digital libraries and repositories for metric research evaluation proceeds by investigating the practical inadequacies of current metric evaluation before defining the scope for libraries and repositories as new players. Subsequently the notion of metrics as research information services is developed. Finally, the future relationship between a) libraries and repositories and b) metrics databases, commercial or non-commercial, is addressed.Service reviewed include: Leiden Ranking, Webometrics Ranking of World Universities, COUNTER, MESUR, Harzing POP, CiteSeer, Citebase, RePEc LogEc and CitEc, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar.},

Contributed papers demonstrate how altmetrics can work on a personal level to enhance a scholar's CV and on a broad, even global level, to transform scholarly communication through its interaction with open access, digital repositories and research in emerging countries. One article suggests altmetrics should soon be included among mainstream metrics, and other contributions describe specific indicators and altmetric software considerations.

@article{Liu2013b,
abstract = {Background: Citation counts for peer-reviewed articles and the impact factor of journals have long been indicators of article importance or quality. In the Web 2.0 era, growing numbers of scholars are using scholarly social network tools to communicate scientific ideas with colleagues, thereby making traditional indicators less sufficient, immediate, and comprehensive. In these new situations, the altmetric indicators offer alternative measures that reflect the multidimensional nature of scholarly impact in an immediate, open, and individualized way. In this direction of research, some studies have demonstrated the correlation between altmetrics and traditional metrics with different samples. However, up to now, there has been relatively little research done on the dimension and interaction structure of altmetrics. Objective: Our goal was to reveal the number of dimensions that altmetric indicators should be divided into and the structure in which altmetric indicators interact with each other. Methods: Because an article-level metrics dataset is collected from scholarly social media and open access platforms, it is one of the most robust samples available to study altmetric indicators. Therefore, we downloaded a large dataset containing activity data in 20 types of metrics present in 33,128 academic articles from the application programming interface website. First, we analyzed the correlation among altmetric indicators using Spearman rank correlation. Second, we visualized the multiple correlation coefficient matrixes with graduated colors. Third, inputting the correlation matrix, we drew an MDS diagram to demonstrate the dimension for altmetric indicators. For correlation structure, we used a social network map to represent the social relationships and the strength of relations. Results: We found that the distribution of altmetric indicators is significantly non-normal and positively skewed. The distribution of downloads and page views follows the Pareto law. Moreover, we found that the Spearman coefficients from 91.58\% of the pairs of variables indicate statistical significance at the .01 level. The non-metric MDS map divided the 20 altmetric indicators into three clusters: traditional metrics, active altmetrics, and inactive altmetrics. The social network diagram showed two subgroups that are tied to each other but not to other groups, thus indicating an intersection between altmetrics and traditional metric indicators. Conclusions: Altmetrics complement, and most correlate significantly with, traditional measures. Therefore, in future evaluations of the social impact of articles, we should consider not only traditional metrics but also active altmetrics. There may also be a transfer phenomenon for the social impact of academic articles. The impact transfer path has transfer, or intermediate, stations that transport and accelerate article social impact from active altmetrics to traditional metrics and vice versa. This discovery will be helpful to explain the impact transfer mechanism of articles in the Web 2.0 era. Hence, altmetrics are in fact superior to traditional filters for assessing scholarly impact in multiple dimensions and in terms of social structure.  [J Med Internet Res 2013;15(11):e259]},

The results show that tweeting behavior varies between journals and specialties and correlations between tweets and citations are low, implying that impact metrics based on tweets are different from those based on citations. A framework utilizing the coverage of articles and the correlation between Twitter mentions and citations is proposed to facilitate the evaluation of novel social-media based metrics and to shed light on the question in how far the number of tweets is a valid metric to measure research impact.},

abstract = {In an article written five years ago [arXiv:0809.0522], we described a method for predicting which scientific papers will be highly cited in the future, even if they are currently not highly cited. Applying the method to real citation data we made predictions about papers we believed would end up being well cited. Here we revisit those predictions, five years on, to see how well we did. Among the over 2000 papers in our original data set, we examine the fifty that, by the measures of our previous study, were predicted to do best and we find that they have indeed received substantially more citations in the intervening years than other papers, even after controlling for the number of prior citations. On average these top fifty papers have received 23 times as many citations in the last five years as the average paper in the data set as a whole, and 15 times as many as the average paper in a randomly drawn control group that started out with the same number of citations. Applying our prediction technique to current data, we also make new predictions of papers that we believe will be well cited in the next few years.},

@article{Fausto2012a,
abstract = {Increasing public interest in science information in a digital and 2.0 science era promotes a dramatically, rapid and deep change in science itself. The emergence and expansion of new technologies and internet-based tools is leading to new means to improve scientific methodology and communication, assessment, promotion and certification. It allows methods of acquisition, manipulation and storage, generating vast quantities of data that can further facilitate the research process. It also improves access to scientific results through information sharing and discussion. Content previously restricted only to specialists is now available to a wider audience. This context requires new management systems to make scientific knowledge more accessible and useable, including new measures to evaluate the reach of scientific information. The new science and research quality measures are strongly related to the new online technologies and services based in social media. Tools such as blogs, social bookmarks and online reference managers, Twitter and others offer alternative, transparent and more comprehensive information about the active interest, usage and reach of scientific publications. Another of these new filters is the Research Blogging platform, which was created in 2007 and now has over 1,230 active blogs, with over 26,960 entries posted about peer-reviewed research on subjects ranging from Anthropology to Zoology. This study takes a closer look at RB, in order to get insights into its contribution to the rapidly changing landscape of scientific communication.},

@article{Wardle2010,
abstract = {There is an increasing demand for an effective means of post-publication evaluation of ecological work that avoids pitfalls associated with using the impact factor of the journal in which the work was published. One approach that has been gaining momentum is the 'Faculty of 1000' (hereafter F1000) evaluation procedure, in which panel members identify what they believe to be the most 'important' recent publications they have read. Here I focused on 1530 publications from 7 major ecological journals that appeared in 2005, and compared the F1000 rating of each publication with the frequency with which it was subsequently cited. The mean and median citation frequencies of the 103 publications highlighted by F1000 was higher than for all 1530 publications, but not substantially so. Further, the F1000 procedure did not highlight any of the 11 publications that were each cited over 130 (and up to 497) times, while it did highlight 14 publications that were each cited between 4 and 9 times. Further, 46\% and 31\% of all manuscripts highlighted by F1000 were cited less often than the mean and median respectively of all 1530 publications. Possible reasons for the F1000 process failing to identify high impact publications may include uneven coverage by F1000 of different ecological topics, cronyism, and geographical bias favoring North American publications. As long as the F1000 process cannot identify those publications that subsequently have the greatest impact, it cannot be reliably used as a means of post-publication evaluation of the ecological literature.},

@article{Priem2012,
abstract = {Although many observers have advocated the reform of the scholarly publishing system, improvements to functions like peer review have been adopted sluggishly. We argue that this is due to the tight coupling of the journal system: the system's essential functions of archiving, registration, dissemination, and certification are bundled together and siloed into tens of thousands of individual journals. This tight coupling makes it difficult to change any one aspect of the system, choking out innovation. We suggest that the solution is the “decoupled journal (DcJ).” In this system, the functions are unbundled and performed as services, able to compete for patronage and evolve in response to the market. For instance, a scholar might deposit an article in her institutional repository, have it copyedited and typeset by one company, indexed for search by several others, self-marketed over her own social networks, and peer reviewed by one or more stamping agencies that connect her paper to external reviewers. The DcJ brings publishing out of its current seventeenth-century paradigm, and creates a Web-like environment of loosely joined pieces—a marketplace of tools that, like the Web, evolves quickly in response to new technologies and users' needs. Importantly, this system is able to evolve from the current one, requiring only the continued development of bolt-on services external to the journal, particularly for peer review.},

@article{Hajjem2005a,
abstract = {To further test its cross-disciplinary generality, we used 1,307,038 articles published across 12 years (1992-2003) in 10 disciplines (Biology, Psychology, Sociology, Health, Political Science, Economics, Education, Law, Business, Management). We designed a robot that trawls the Web for full-texts using reference metadata (author, title, journal, etc.) and citation data from the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) database. A preliminary signal-detection analysis of the robot's accuracy yielded a signal detectability d'=2.45 and bias = 0.52. The overall percentage of OA (relative to total OA + NOA) articles varies from 5\%-16\% (depending on discipline, year and country) and is slowly climbing annually (correlation r=.76, sample size N=12, probability p < 0.005). Comparing OA and NOA articles in the same journal/year, OA articles have consistently more citations, the advantage varying from 25\%-250\% by discipline and year. Comparing articles within six citation ranges (0, 1, 2-3, 4-7, 8-15, 16+ citations), the annual percentage of OA articles is growing significantly faster than NOA within every citation range (r > .90, N=12, p < .0005) and the effect is greater with the more highly cited articles (r = .98, N=6, p < .005). Causality cannot be determined from these data, but our prior finding of a similar pattern in physics, where percent OA is much higher (and even approaches 100\% in some subfields), makes it unlikely that the OA citation advantage is merely or mostly a self-selection bias (for making only one's better articles OA). Further research will analyze the effect's timing, causal components and relation to other variables, such as, download counts, journal citation averages, article quality, co-citation measures, hub/authority ranks, growth rate, longevity, and other new impact measures generated by the growing OA database. },

abstract = {Qualitative journal evaluation makes use of cumulated content descriptions of single articles. These can either be represented by author-generated keywords, professionally indexed subject headings, automatically extracted terms or by reader-generated tags as used in social bookmarking systems. It is assumed that particularly the users’ view on article content differs significantly from the authors’ or indexers’ perspectives. To verify this assumption, title and abstract terms, author keywords, Inspec subject headings, KeyWords PlusTM and tags are compared by calculating the overlap between the respective datasets. Our approach includes extensive term preprocessing (i.e. stemming, spelling unifications) to gain a homogeneous term collection. When term overlap is calculated for every single document of the dataset, similarity values are low. Thus, the presented study confirms the assumption, that the different types of keywords each reflect a different perspective of the articles’ contents and that tags (cumulated across articles) can be used in journal evaluation to represent a reader-specific view on published content.},
